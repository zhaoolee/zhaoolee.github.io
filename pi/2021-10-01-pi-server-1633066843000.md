title: Raspberry Pi Doesn't Gather Dust Issue 1 Flashing Ubuntu Server 20.04, Binding a Public Domain Name, Providing HTTP Services to the Public Network, and SSH Login Service
categories:
- Raspberry Pi Doesn't Gather Dust / Use Pi
---

A while ago, I bought an 8GB RAM Raspberry Pi 4B and used a USB wireless card to turn it into a soft router `Turning a Raspberry Pi 4B with an OpenWrt image into a portable router that transforms standard wifi into magic wifi https://v2fy.com/p/2021-07-04-openwrt-4b-1625383754000/`, but later I felt that it was a waste to use an 8GB Raspberry Pi as a soft router. So this time, I transformed the Raspberry Pi 4B into a server accessible from the public network to run some memory-intensive tasks.

The native system of Raspberry Pi is not as rich in packages as Ubuntu, so this time I chose to flash Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS.

To ensure that the Raspberry Pi server at home could be accessed from the public network, I used the open-source FRP technology for internal network penetration to bind the domain name `frp.v2fy.com` to the Raspberry Pi. Accessing the HTTP service on the Raspberry Pi is as simple as visiting https://frp.v2fy.com. I also set up SSH mapping so that the Raspberry Pi can be accessed via SSH by connecting to port 6000 of `frp.v2fy.com` on the public network.

## Principle Structure Diagram

**About the Architecture of Internal Network Penetration**

The browser's default requests to a domain name point to ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). I installed Nginx on the server end to occupy ports 80 and 443 for receiving HTTP and HTTPS requests. Then I wrote a set of rules to forward all requests targeting `frp.v2fy.com` to port 8080. Part of the HTTPS rules also include configuration of an HTTPS certificate for `frp.v2fy.com` (Nginx automatic certificate renewal operation can be referred to `Independence! Using acme.sh to set up multiple HTTPS certificates for nginx to automatically update, and indefinitely renew HTTPS certificates https://v2fy.com/p/2021-06-27-nginx-https-1624774964000/`), and port 8080 is occupied by the FRP server process frps, which sends requests to the FRP client frpc on the Raspberry Pi. FRPC then forwards requests from FRP to the http-server service running on 8080 on the Raspberry Pi; the SSH forwarding rule is similar to the HTTP forwarding rule, forwarding from the server's port 6000 to the Raspberry Pi's port 22.

## Preliminary Preparation

1. Indispensable Raspberry Pi kit: A Raspberry Pi (generations 2, 3, 4 are all suitable, I chose the Raspberry Pi 4B), Raspberry Pi power supply, an SD card of at least 8GB (16GB or above recommended).
2. One good network cable with RJ45 connectors on both ends.
3. A router with internet access and one available LAN port.
4. A public network server with a fixed IP.
5. One domain name.
6. A 32GB or larger flash drive or high-capacity hard drive for expanding the server storage of the Raspberry Pi (optional).

## Using SD Card Formatter to Format SD Card

SD Card Formatter download link `https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/`

![Using SD Card Formatter to Format SD Card](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633067238461yjfCT3GH.png)

![After formatting, the partitions are combined into one, showing the real capacity](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633067238459yy8e3jiw.png)

## Download Image

Download the image from `https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi/thank-you?version=20.04.3&architecture=server-arm64+raspi`

![Download Image](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633067238461ThBcpbeQ.png)

After clicking download now on the page, you will get the file ubuntu-20.04.3-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi.img.

![ubuntu-20.04.3-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi.img](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633067238550pr71MWDD.png)

If your browser often fails to download, I suggest putting `https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/20.04.3/release/ubuntu-20.04.3-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi.img.xz` directly into Free Download Manager for downloading (Free Download Manager is a free download tool with free cloud acceleration download function, which is friendly for downloading overseas resources).

## Using balenaEtcher to Flash the Image onto the SD Card

balenaEtcher download link `https://www.balena.io/etcher/`

Select the version you need to download according to your own system. If you're on Windows, you can directly download the first one shown below.

![Choose the version you need to download according to your own system](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633067238705M2b8hWKS.png)

Open Etcher, select the image file, choose the SD card, and start burning.

![Start Burning](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/163306723902278ntpzzK.png)

Here in the image it's an 8GB SD card, but after a few failed attempts, I switched to a 16GB memory card and succeeded on the first try. If your burning fails repeatedly, I suggest trying with another SD card.

Insert the burned SD card into the Raspberry Pi, connect the Raspberry Pi to the router's LAN port with a network cable, and power on the device.

## Log into the Router Backend to Check the IP Assigned to the Raspberry Pi with Ubuntu Installed

**Below, we use FRP internal network penetration to give the Raspberry Pi home server an external domain name** 



## Internal Network Penetration: Server Setup

First, resolve your domain name to your server IP. The following steps will involve four server ports. To facilitate subsequent debugging runs, please open up the security policies for the following ports: 80 (for Nginx to receive HTTP requests), 443 (for Nginx to receive HTTPS requests), 6000 (for forwarding SSH services), and 8080 (for forwarding HTTP services) ports.




- Configure Nginx to forward requests for the frp.v2fy.com domain to the 8080 port (before doing this step, please install Nginx according to your server's operating system).


Set `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`



```
#user  nginx;
worker_processes  1;
load_module /usr/lib64/nginx/modules/ngx_stream_module.so;

error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log warn;
pid        /var/run/nginx.pid;

stream {
    map $ssl_preread_server_name $backend_name {
        frp.v2fy.com        frp_v2fy_com;
        default web;
    }


   upstream frp_v2fy_com {
        server 127.0.0.1:8081;
   }

   upstream web {
        server 127.0.0.1:80;
   }

   server {
        listen       443 reuseport;
        listen  [::]:443 reuseport;
        proxy_pass   $backend_name;
        ssl_preread  on;
   }

}

events {
    worker_connections  1024;
}

http {

    include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;
    charset utf-8,gbk;
    client_max_body_size 20m;

    set_real_ip_from 127.0.0.1;
    real_ip_header X-Forwarded-For;


    log_format  main  '$remote_addr  - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                      '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                      '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';
    access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log  main;

    sendfile        on;
    #tcp_nopush     on;
    keepalive_timeout  65;
    gzip  on;
    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
}
```

Create `/etc/nginx/conf.d/frp.v2fy.com.conf`, and write the following content into `/etc/nginx/conf.d/frp.v2fy.com.conf` (frp.v2fy.com is my domain, please replace it with your own domain name)



```
server {
    server_name      frp.v2fy.com;
    listen           80;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host:80;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}


server {
    listen       8081 ssl http2;
    listen       [::]:8081 ssl http2;
    server_name  frp.v2fy.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host:443;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

    ssl_certificate "/etc/nginx/ssl/frp.v2fy.com/fullchain.cer";
    ssl_certificate_key "/etc/nginx/ssl/frp.v2fy.com/frp.v2fy.com.key";
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:1m;
    ssl_session_timeout  10m;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    # Load configuration files for the default server block.
    include /etc/nginx/default.d/*.conf;
```
Here is the translation of the provided Simplified Chinese Markdown documentation into English:

```markdown
error_page 404 /404.html;
    location = /40x.html {
}

error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
}
```

Restart nginx

```
nginx -t
nginx -s reload
```

- Download frp and set up the server side

Frp software is divided into two parts, the client is frpc, the server is frps

```
cd /opt/
wget https://github.com/fatedier/frp/releases/download/v0.37.0/frp_0.37.0_linux_386.tar.gz
tar zxvf https://github.com/fatedier/frp/releases/download/v0.37.0/frp_0.37.0_linux_386.tar.gz
```

The server side's frpc configuration file is frpc.ini

![Server and Client](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633067238512Mj3MmBzx.png)

We need to modify the server-side configuration file frps.ini

![Modify the server configuration file frps.ini](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633067239301Yzkk2mzD.png)

```
[common]
bind_port = 7000
vhost_http_port = 8080
```

The above configuration means that the server side of frp named frps is running on port 7000, and it will forward requests targeting port 8080 to the client side;

- Run the following command to start the frp server-side program

```
./frps -c frps.ini
```

![Start the program, run successfully](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633067239183TEXNnYF8.png)

frps runs in the foreground by default. If you want to run it as a background daemon process, you can use the Node.JS version of pm2 to keep it running.

- Global installation method for pm2

First, install Node.js (please choose the appropriate Node.js version for your server OS), npm is installed by default with Node.js, then use npm to install pm2

```
npm i pm2 -g
```

pm2 is also simple to use

First, save `./frps -c frps.ini` in a file named `start_frps.sh`

Then run

```
pm2 start /opt/frp_0.37.0_linux_arm64/start_frps.sh
pm2 save
```

This way you can run frps as a daemon process!

At this point, running `pm2 list`, you can see that the script is running...

![The script is running...](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633067239091KwNxktFy.png)

##  Intranet Penetration: Client Setup

- Execute the following command on the Raspberry Pi to download and extract frp

```
cd /opt/
sudo wget https://github.com/fatedier/frp/releases/download/v0.37.0/frp_0.37.0_linux_arm64.tar.gz
sudo tar zxvf frp_0.37.0_linux_arm64.tar.gz
```

Enter `/opt/frp_0.37.0_linux_arm64`

Backup the client-side frpc's configuration file frpc.ini

```
sudo cp frpc.ini frpc.ini_backup
```

- Edit frpc.ini

```
sudo vim frpc.ini
```

- Insert the following configuration into frpc.ini

```
[common]
server_addr = (your server public IP)
server_port = 7000

[web]
type = http
local_port = 8080
custom_domains = frp.v2fy.com
```

![](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633067239194E7K5wsiE.png)

- Use a web browser to access the Raspberry Pi from the public network to verify if the intranet penetration is successful

![Intranet Penetration Successful](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633067239241fpbGMSds.png)

#### Install Node.js (using the ARMv8 version of the stable Node.js)

(Updated January 14, 2024) If you want to install Node.js automatically, it's recommended to use `nvm` https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
nvm install 20.11.0
nvm alias default 20.11.0
```

After checking the wiki for Raspberry Pi CPU architecture, it seems that Raspberry Pi Series 3 and later versions are ARMv8 architecture

![Architecture](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633067238656yym0n7K3.png)

Use the ARMv8 version of the stable Node.js

![Use the Stable Version of Node.js for ARMv8](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633067239296WYzGbHcX.png)

```
cd /opt/
sudo wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.18.0/node-v14.18.0-linux-arm64.tar.xz
sudo tar xvf node-v14.18.0-linux-arm64.tar.xz
```

- Add Node.js to system variables

```
sudo echo "export NODE_HOME=/opt/node-v14.18.0-linux-arm64" >> ~/.bashrc
sudo echo "export PATH=\$NODE_HOME/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

![Add Node.js to System Variables](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633067239542M6rDSx6f.png)

- Install the http-server service

```
npm install http-server -g
```

![Install http-server Service](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633067239314E2RkyMmh.png)

- Create a `frp.v2fy.com` folder in the `/opt` directory and create a hello.txt file

```
sudo mkdir /opt/frp.v2fy.com
sudo chmod 777 -R  /opt/frp.v2fy.com
sudo touch /opt/frp.v2fy.com/hello.txt
sudo echo "Hello World! Success! " > /opt/frp.v2fy.com/hello.txt
```

- Install pm2

```
npm install pm2 -g
```

- Use pm2 to daemonize the http-server service

```
cd /opt/frp_0.37.0_linux_arm64 
sudo chmod 777 start_http_server.sh
sudo echo "http-server /opt/frp.v2fy.com -p 8080" > start_http_server.sh
pm2 start /opt/frp_0.37.0_linux_arm64/start_http_server.sh
pm2 save
```

- Use pm2 to daemonize the frpc service

```
sudo touch /opt/frp_0.37.0_linux_arm64/start_frpc.sh
sudo chmod 777 /opt/frp_0.37.0_linux_arm64/start_frpc.sh
sudo echo "/opt/frp_0.37.0_linux_arm64/frpc -c /opt/frp_0.37.0_linux_arm64/frpc.ini" > /opt/frp_0.37.0_linux_arm64/start_frpc.sh
cd /opt/frp_0.37.0_linux_arm64/
pm2 start  /opt/frp_0.37.0_linux_arm64/start_frpc.sh
pm2 save
```

![pm2 Successfully Daemonizes frpc and http-server Services](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633067239590etMQaWEY.png)

Visit https://frp.v2fy.com

![Page Display](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633067239853MZEBxdne.png)

![File Content Access Successful](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633067239216BEt00mCX.png)

Here you can successfully access the HTTPS services of a home server via the public network.

## Add SSH service

- Add configuration

![Add ssh Configuration in frpc.ini](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/16330672395672jNxSG7h.png)

```
[ssh]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 22
remote_port = 6000
```
The configuration means to map the default ssh port 22 of the Raspberry Pi to port 6000 of frp.v2fy.com



- Restart the frpc service

```
cd /opt/frp_0.37.0_linux_arm64
pm2 restart start_frpc.sh
```

- Log in through the ssh of the public network frp.v2fy.com at port 6000

```
ssh ubuntu@frp.v2fy.com -p 6000
```

![Login Successful](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633067239416kDAkBXGy.png)

Thus, we can access our home Raspberry Pi server via ssh from any computer on the internet.




## Set pm2 to start on boot, so that after an accidental power loss and restart of the Raspberry Pi, it can automatically start the intranet penetration

## Adding More Capacity to Raspberry Pi (with a 32GB USB Drive)

The SD card I am using is only 16GB, which is too small, so I plugged a 32GB USB drive into the Raspberry Pi for expanded capacity. After inserting the USB drive into the Raspberry Pi, enter the following command to see if the USB drive is recognized:

```
sudo fdisk -l
```
![USB drive recognized successfully](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633067239437XpNPMQPM.png)

The USB drive is located at `/dev/sda1`.

- Mount `/dev/sda1` to `/mnt/sda1`:

```
sudo mkdir /mnt/sda1
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1
```
Enter `/mnt/sda1`, and you can read and write files to the USB drive.

![Access the expanded USB drive space](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633067239322KaCDip7B.png)

We can also mount the USB drive to the web service folder:
```
sudo mkdir /opt/frp.v2fy.com/sda1
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /opt/frp.v2fy.com/sda1
```

![web folder](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/16330672398552H8STz6x.png)

Once again, visit `https://frp.v2fy.com`, and you can access all the files on the USB drive via `https://frp.v2fy.com/sda1`.

## Conclusion

Through this operation, I provided a domain name frp.v2fy.com for the home-use Raspberry Pi by using internal network penetration, which can be accessed via the public network; by configuring ssh, it is possible to remotely log in using ssh to the frp.v2fy.com port 6000 from anywhere on the internet.

Recently zhaoolee has been researching K8S clusters and needed a few high-performance hosts, but memory and hard drives are too expensive, so he put the Raspberry Pi 4B to use. With internal network penetration, it can serve like a real server on the internet.

Setting up your own server at home is every boy's dream. As long as there are no power outages, no internet disconnections, and the Raspberry Pi board doesn't explode, we can have an extremely cost-effective server at a very low cost.
