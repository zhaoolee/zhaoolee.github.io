title: "Raspberry Pi No Dust" Issue 13 Quickly Manage Docker Services and Images on Raspberry Pi with the Lazydocker Command-Line GUI
categories:
- Raspberry Pi No Dust / Use Pi
---

In order to facilitate the management, deployment, expansion, and migration of Raspberry Pi program services, we use Docker to run programs. However, Docker management itself is also a challenge. People who are lazy won’t be willing to remember and look up various Docker commands. To make it more convenient for Docker users to manage Docker, I recommend Lazydocker. Lazydocker is an open-source project that allows you to easily manage Docker via mouse and keyboard shortcuts in the terminal without a GUI desktop—managing all aspects of Docker in a lazy way~

## Installing Lazydocker

I’m going to install lazydocker using Docker, which means building the lazydocker image locally~

```
sudo docker build -t lazyteam/lazydocker \
--build-arg BASE_IMAGE_BUILDER=arm64v8/golang \
--build-arg GOARCH=arm64 \
https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker.git
```

## Running Lazydocker

```
mkdir /opt/lazydocker

sudo docker run --rm -it -v \
/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
-v /opt/lazydocker:/.config/jesseduffield/lazydocker \
lazyteam/lazydocker
```
- Initial setup

- If you see the following interface, it means Lazydocker has been successfully installed and is running

## Installing zsh and configuring oh-my-zsh (Optional)

```
sudo apt install zsh -y

sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

- Setting the default shell to zsh (Optional)

![zsh](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/16404297676294Zz58M8w.png)

```
# Check the location of zsh
which zsh
# Change the default shell for the current user (you need to enter the current user's login password)
chsh
# Enter the path of zsh
/usr/bin/zsh
# Switch to zsh directly
/usr/bin/zsh

```

## Setting up shortcut commands for zsh (If you have not installed zsh, please replace the zsh characters in the commands below with your own shell)

```
# Set up the shortcut command ‘lzd’ for starting Lazydocker in the zsh configuration file  
echo "alias lzd='sudo docker run --rm -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /opt/lazyload/config:/.config/jesseduffield/lazydocker lazyteam/lazydocker'" >> ~/.zshrc
# Make the lzd command effective
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Starting Lazydocker via Command Line

```
lzd
```

- Check the status of running containers

![Check the Status of the Running Container](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1640429767822EFByRREt.png)

- Enter the container

![Enter the Container](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1640429767999ifNZc6bc.png)

The default shell in use is sh. Since we used exec -it to enter the container, exiting with Ctrl+D won't stop the container

- Common shortcut commands related to containers

```
[: Previous tab (The "Tab" here refers to Logs, Stats, Config, Top on the right) 
]: Next tab
d: Delete the current container
e: Hide or show terminated containers
s: Stop the current container
r: Restart the current container
a: Attach to the current container, and you can see the logs produced inside the container in real-time (exit with Ctrl+D)
m: View the real-time logs of the current container (exit with Ctrl+C)  
E: Open a shell on a running container with exec -it, the shell exiting will not affect the running container 
b: Invoke the batch operation command window for containers 
```
- Common shortcut commands related to images

```
d: Delete an image 
b: Invoke the batch operation command window for images 
```

## Summary

The advent of Docker has greatly facilitated the development and deployment of programs. However, a misentered Docker command can easily lead to blunders such as accidentally deleting containers or images. With Lazydocker, we can easily and happily manage our Docker services.
