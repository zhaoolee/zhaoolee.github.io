To collect RSS information from various websites, you must have an RSS data source. I found an open-source project called RSSHub that provides RSS data sources. It can be privately deployed to the Raspberry Pi, and then the Raspberry Pi's RSS data source can be opened to the public network. This allows "RSSHub!", which relies on Github Actions to run regularly, to easily obtain data sources.

This article is a tutorial on deploying RSSHub to the Raspberry Pi and opening it up to the public network.

## Install docker and docker-compose

Please refer to the previously written article "Raspberry Pi Not Just Collecting Dust" Issue 4: Using Raspberry Pi to Build a Public Network Personal Download Platform aria2-pro, Recommending 6 High-Quality Torrent Resource Sites https://v2fy.com/p/2021-10-05-pi-bt-aria2-pro-1633436631000/


## Get docker-compose.yml
```
cd /opt/
sudo mkdir rsshub
sudo chmod 777 -R rsshub
cd /opt/rsshub
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/master/docker-compose.yml
```

- Contents of docker-compose.yml

```
version: '3'

services:
    rsshub:
        image: diygod/rsshub
        restart: always
        ports:
            - '1200:1200'
        environment:
            NODE_ENV: production
            CACHE_TYPE: redis
            REDIS_URL: 'redis://redis:6379/'
            PUPPETEER_WS_ENDPOINT: 'ws://browserless:3000'
        depends_on:
            - redis
            - browserless

    browserless:
        # See issue 6680
        image: browserless/chrome:1.43-chrome-stable
        restart: always
        ulimits:
          core:
            hard: 0
            soft: 0

    redis:
        image: redis:alpine
        restart: always
        volumes:
            - redis-data:/data

volumes:
    redis-data:
```

From the configuration information, we can see that the server port is 1200.


## Create volume to persist Redis cache


```
sudo docker volume create redis-data
```

## Start RSSHub

```
cd /opt/rsshub
sudo docker-compose up -d
```
![Service created successfully](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1634691008930eDa2R1xd.png)


- Access the 1200 port of the Raspberry Pi's IP

You can see that the service is now accessible.


## Map rsshub to the 1200 port of an external server using frp

For frp installation and usage refer to "Raspberry Pi Not Just Collecting Dust" Issue 1: Flash Ubuntu Server 20.04, Bind Public Network Domain Name, Provide HTTP Service to Public Network, SSH Login Service https://v2fy.com/p/2021-10-01-pi-server-1633066843000/


- Add the following configuration to frpc.ini and restart frpc

```

[rsshub-frp-v2fy-com-1200]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 1200
remote_port = 1200
```


## Access http://frp.v2fy.com:1200 to see the successful mapping

![Mapping successful](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1634691008963mTxK3TnP.png)


If we resolve the subdomain rsshub.v2fy.com to the external host IP, the result of accessing http://frp.v2fy.com:1200 and http://rsshub.v2fy.com:1200 is the same

RSSHub is essentially a collection of crawlers that generate RSS information for various web pages. By reading RSSHub's documentation, we can obtain RSS information from all kinds of well-known websites.

## Summary


Providing RSS on websites is a virtue; as the content on the internet grows, searching has become more difficult, and various content platforms restrict their content within their own apps, leading to search engines not being able to crawl the latest content, making our searches harder.

If we rely on a content platform's app to get content, it is easy to have our ways of thinking domesticated by big data, and we passively form an information cocoon.

An information cocoon refers to the phenomenon where the scope of information people pay attention to is habitually guided by their own interests, thus confining their lives to a "cocoon room" similar to a silkworm's cocoon.

This article provides you with a new way of acquiring information. You can subscribe to the information stream you need through "RSSHub" and "Gah! RSS", allowing classic internet technology to serve you.

## Benefits

I added a certificate to rsshub.v2fy.com

Accessing https://rsshub.v2fy.com/ and https://rsshub.v2fy.com:1200 has the same effect, and it is currently serving the public network.

An 8GB Raspberry Pi paired with Redis caching works pretty well!
