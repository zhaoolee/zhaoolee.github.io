NetEase Cloud Music spans across Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS platforms and provides free music cloud storage for various non-copyrighted songs. This article presents a method to unlock greyed-out songs on NetEase Cloud with a Raspberry Pi, store the songs on NetEase cloud storage, and listen to them across all platforms. The article also provides a way to publish the unlocked service to the internet via internal network penetration, allowing you to share the unlocking service with your friends.

On some treasure (Taobao), this unlocking service can even be sold as goods, bringing in a considerable profit!

## First, download the open-source NetEase Cloud Music Unlock project

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/nondanee/UnblockNeteaseMusic.git /opt/UnblockNeteaseMusic
```

## Enter the folder of the NetEase cloud open-source unlock project

```
/opt/UnblockNeteaseMusic
```

## Set the running port to 8686 (according to your preference)

```
## Make a backup of the configuration file
sudo cp   /opt/UnblockNeteaseMusic/docker-compose.yml /opt/UnblockNeteaseMusic/docker-compose.yml_backup
## Add read and write permissions to the configuration file
sudo chmod 777  /opt/UnblockNeteaseMusic/docker-compose.yml

## Overwrite content into docker-compose.yml
sudo cat >/opt/UnblockNeteaseMusic/docker-compose.yml<<EOF
version: '3'

services:
  unblockneteasemusic:
    image: nondanee/unblockneteasemusic
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: production
    ports:
      - 8686:8080
EOF

# Check if the write was successful
cat  /opt/UnblockNeteaseMusic/docker-compose.yml

```


## Run the service with docker

```
cd   /opt/UnblockNeteaseMusic/
sudo  docker-compose up
```

- Test it out by opening NetEase Cloud Music settings, and the Raspberry Pi will print new request information

We can map the service on the Raspberry Pi's 8686 port to a cloud server

If you have questions about frpc configuration, please review the previous issue [“Raspberry Pi Not Gathering Dust” Installing Ubuntu Server 20.04, Binding a Public Domain, Providing Public Internet HTTP Service, SSH Login Service https://v2fy.com/p/2021-10-01-pi-server-1633066843000/](https://v2fy.com/p/2021-10-01-pi-server-1633066843000/)

- Add the following configuration to /opt/frp_0.37.0_linux_arm64/frpc.ini


```
[music-v2fy-com-8686]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 8686
remote_port = 8686
```

- Restart frpc


![Restart frpc service](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1636206350976k0xPw5zj.png)


```
pm2 restart  start_frpc
pm2 save
```

Since we have already bound frp.v2fy.com to a cloud server in the previous issues, you can directly access the Raspberry Pi's NetEase Cloud Music unlock service through http://frp.v2fy.com:8686

- After the song download is complete, check the storage location

- Open My Music Cloud Storage, upload to NetEase Cloud Storage, then you can also enjoy music on your phone side

- After uploading is complete, you can open the mobile app and happily listen to music and see comments through the cloud storage

The cloud storage has 60GB of free space, which is more than enough for an average person as long as you don't upload a large number of lossless music files.

Furthermore, the NetEase Cloud PC version has recently updated with a full-screen pure listening feature

The large-screen jukebox style UI is quite impressive!

## Summary
This article has completed the public network unlock service. The Windows version is the easiest to configure for unlocking. If you want to unlock on mobile platforms such as iOS, Android, etc., it is theoretically feasible, but the configuration is relatively complicated.
