title: "Raspberry Pi No Dust" Issue 16 Setting up Calibre Web to Establish an Internet-Accessible Private E-book Library
categories:
- Raspberry Pi No Dust / Use Pi
---

I've been organizing my collection of e-books lately in order to access them through the public internet at any time. Although Calibre's desktop version is powerful, and it can start a local HTTP server, the HTTP interface is still too rudimentary.

I came across an open-source project called Calibre Web, which has a much more comfortable interface, supports multi-user management, and can be directly deployed on a Raspberry Pi home server without a desktop environment!

Calibre Web open-source address: https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web

This article is a deployment tutorial for Calibre Web on Raspberry Pi. In the end, we'll map the HTTP service to the public internet, allowing us to read and share our e-book library from computers or phones anytime, anywhere!

## Create a folder to store Calibre-related configuration and data

```
cd /opt/
mkdir /opt/calibre-web
```

## Create a folder `config` to store configuration files and a folder `books` to store e-books

```
mkdir /opt/calibre-web/config
mkdir /opt/calibre-web/books

sudo chmod 777 -R /opt/calibre-web/
```

## Create a Docker Compose file

```
touch /opt/calibre-web/docker-compose.yml
```

Write the following content inside `docker-compose.yml`

```
version: "2.1"
services:
  calibre-web:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/calibre-web:latest
    container_name: calibre-web
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
      - DOCKER_MODS=linuxserver/mods:universal-calibre #optional
      - OAUTHLIB_RELAX_TOKEN_SCOPE=1 #optional
    volumes:
      - /opt/calibre-web/config:/config
      - /opt/calibre-web/books:/books
    ports:
      - 8083:8083
    restart: unless-stopped
```

If you do not need to modify the above configuration, you can directly write the configuration with the following command line

```
sudo bash -c 'cat > /opt/calibre-web/docker-compose.yml' <<-'EOF'
version: "2.1"
services:
  calibre-web:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/calibre-web:latest
    container_name: calibre-web
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
      - DOCKER_MODS=linuxserver/mods:universal-calibre #optional
      - OAUTHLIB_RELAX_TOKEN_SCOPE=1 #optional
    volumes:
      - /opt/calibre-web/config:/config
      - /opt/calibre-web/books:/books
    ports:
      - 8083:8083
    restart: unless-stopped
EOF
```

## Start Calibre Web

Run `sudo docker-compose up -d` in the `/opt/calibre-web/` directory

```
cd /opt/calibre-web/
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

## How to Manage Books

Calibre Web does not currently provide book management features. We need to install the Calibre desktop client to manage the database of the web version of Calibre.


Calibre client download: https://calibre-ebook.com/zh_HK/download

The `/opt/calibre-web/config/metadata.db` file is located on a Raspberry Pi, and the locally installed Calibre client cannot directly read and write to `/opt/calibre-web/config/metadata.db`. We can open the smb service on the Raspberry Pi (you can refer to the previous tutorial "Raspberry Pi Uncovered" Issue 2: The Future Technology of the Cloud Storage World, add smb service and achieve intranet penetration, so that all devices share files https://v2fy.com/p/2021-10-03-pi-smb-1633231650000/), mount the Raspberry Pi's `/opt/` folder locally, and thus enable the local Calibre client to read and write the `/opt/calibre-web/config/metadata.db` file.


After mounting via smb, we can access the Raspberry Pi's files just like accessing a local disk.

- If you want to use it on the public network, you just need to add the port opening rule for 8083 in the Raspberry Pi's frpc.ini


```
[books-frp-v2fy-com-8083]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 8083
remote_port = 8083
```
After setting it up, remember to restart the frpc on the Raspberry Pi and open the port 8083 on the cloud server.

For specific settings of frp's intranet penetration, you can refer to episodes 001 and 004 of "Raspberry Pi Uncovered". The frp settings are the same for both, so I will not repeat them here.

## Some Practical Experience

Calibre Web has not yet implemented cross-device progress synchronization. The same account logged in on the mobile and PC ends will not sync reading progress. It only records the last reading position on the current device. However, Calibre Web's bookmarks do support cross-device progress synchronization. You can add a bookmark when you stop reading on device A, and then open that bookmark on device B to jump to the corresponding location.

If Calibre Web reports a 500 error (which can occur when the database is operated on by several Calibre clients at the same time, potentially leading to database deadlocks), typically restarting the Docker service for Calibre Web can solve the issue.

This article uses the macOS version of Calibre as an example, but the Windows version of Calibre is actually somewhat easier to use. The traditional Chinese version of the Calibre client has some strange translations, so it is recommended to use the English version of Calibre, which makes the operations commands clear at a glance.

## Summary

Calibre is an ancient yet powerful e-book management tool, and the open-source project Calibre Web uses Calibre's database to convert e-books into a web service that can be accessed over the public internet. It is truly a great Internet product concept.
