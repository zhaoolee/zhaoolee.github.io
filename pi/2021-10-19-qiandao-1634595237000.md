title: Raspberry Pi No Dust Issue 5 Building a Personal Daily Auto-Check-In Platform with Raspberry Pi
categories:
- Raspberry Pi No Dust / Use Pi

To ensure daily activity, various BBS forums and shopping websites often hold daily check-in events. Although the rewards are small, they can add up to a considerable amount of virtual assets over the years.

This article will teach you how to set up automatic check-ins using a Raspberry Pi, and the solution provided is based on Docker. If your Raspberry Pi has not yet installed Docker, please refer to "Raspberry Pi No Dust" Issue 4: Build your public personal download platform aria2-pro with Raspberry Pi, recommending 6 high-quality torrent resource sites https://v2fy.com/p/2021-10-05-pi-bt-aria2-pro-1633436631000/ to complete the Docker installation.




## The Result After Successful Deployment

After adding the check-in tasks to the platform, the platform will run the tasks every 24 hours. By default, each task runs at different times each day depending on the time they were added. For example, if the NetEase Cloud Music task was added at 20:28, then at 20:28 every day, the platform will repeat the NetEase Cloud Music check-in task.



## Deploy Open Source Check-In Platform


Check-in platform open source address https://github.com/qiandao-today/qiandao

- Deploy the check-in platform using docker

```
sudo docker run -d --name qiandao -p 8923:80 -v $(pwd)/qiandao/config:/usr/src/app/config a76yyyy/qiandao
```

- Successful deployment

Compared to the previous screenshot, we can see that the check-in was indeed successful, and an extra day has been added!


- Return to the homepage, where you can see information related to the check-in task

Repeat the above steps, and we can add check-in tasks for various types of websites. Most websites only require cookie parameters to be filled in, and many websites require user name parameters as well. The specific parameters can be referenced in the remarks content of the template~

If the template does not include the website you need, we can also customize the sign-in program according to our own requirements. The tutorial address is `https://github.com/qiandao-today/qiandao/blob/master/docs/har-howto.md`

## Mapping to the Internet { /*examples*/ }

Using frp, this versatile intranet penetration program (for how to use frp, refer to `"Raspberry Pi Dust-Free" Issue 4: Use Raspberry Pi to Set Up a Public Network Personal Download Platform aria2-pro, Recommend 6 High-Quality Seed Resource Sites https://v2fy.com/p/2021-10-05-pi-bt-aria2-pro-1633436631000/ "`), I have mapped port 8923 of the Raspberry Pi to `frp.v2fy.com`, so I can access the sign-in platform from the external network through `http://frp.v2fy.com:8923`

## Summary

The sign-in platform is essentially a spider scheduling program. Developers encapsulate the sign-in request into a spider program. Users subscribe to the spider, fill in cookies, and other necessary parameters. The sign-in platform schedules the spider program to run automatically every other day, thereby achieving the effect of automatic daily sign-in.
