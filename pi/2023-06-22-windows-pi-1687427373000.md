zhaoolee set up Stable Diffusion WebUI on a home Windows desktop machine. To access the Windows desktop's Stable Diffusion WebUI even when away from home, this article uses a Raspberry Pi to proxy the desktop's 3389 port, mapping it to the public network (the following image is produced by Stable Diffusion WebUI, the original image is at the end of the article).

## Enable Remote Connection Service on Windows Desktop to Allow Remote Connections {/ * examples */}

The two images above allow us to obtain the computer name and username that will be used for subsequent logins.

Note, the current Windows user must support password login;

## Assign a Fixed IP to the Windows Desktop via the Router

My desktop's LAN IP is `192.168.50.136`. By binding its MAC address to the IP, the desktop will use IP `192.168.50.136` each time it connects to the network.

## Set Up Port Forwarding on the Raspberry Pi

My Raspberry Pi's IP is `192.168.50.10`, and the default port for Windows' built-in Remote Desktop Connection is 3389.

I created a stream.conf.d folder on the Raspberry Pi's Nginx proxy server.

```
sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/stream.conf.d
```

And added a configuration file `/etc/nginx/stream.conf.d/192.168.50.136-3389-win-remote-desktop-connection.conf`.

```
server {
    listen 3389;
    proxy_pass 192.168.50.136:3389;
}
```

Added stream related settings in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`.

```
http {
    # This line includes all configuration files in the /etc/nginx/conf.d/ directory ending with .conf
    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
}

stream {
    # This line includes all configuration files in the /etc/nginx/stream.conf.d/ directory ending with .conf
    include /etc/nginx/stream.conf.d/*.conf;
}
```

Then check if the configuration file format is correct and restart Nginx.

```
sudo nginx -t
sudo nginx -s reload
```

After the Nginx on the Raspberry Pi is successfully restarted, accessing 192.168.50.10:3389 is equivalent to accessing 192.168.50.136:3389.

## Set Up Public Access via frp

Add configuration to the Raspberry Pi's frpc.ini.

```
[remote-desktop-33891]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 3389
remote_port = 33891
```

This configuration means that requests received on port 33891 of the server side will be forwarded to port 3389 of the Raspberry Pi.

The Raspberry Pi will then forward requests on port 3389 through Nginx to the Windows desktop machine.

## Summary

Although the Raspberry Pi has limited performance, it is very suitable to be used as a gateway. Following the methods described in this article, we can map powerful desktop devices to the public internet, making them available for us to call upon via the internet anytime.

Recently, browsing Taobao, I noticed that the prices for Raspberry Pi 4B are dropping; an 8GB RAM model is now priced around 500 RMB (the original price of Raspberry Pi 4B 8GB was $75 USD), indicating that the price might return to normal by this autumn.

Today is June 22, 2023. Wishing all readers a happy Dragon Boat Festival with good food and drink!
