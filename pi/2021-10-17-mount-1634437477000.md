title: Practical Tips: Auto-Mount External Hard Drive on Raspberry Pi Boot

The storage capacity of Raspberry Pi's SD card is often not enough for our use. If we use the Raspberry Pi as a download server, we need to mount an external hard drive. It is recommended to format the hard drive as exfat, as it is supported for reading and writing on Mac, Windows, and Linux, and also supports storing very large files.

When using an external hard drive, I found that the Raspberry Pi loses the mount point upon reboot. So I learned and organized the configuration for the Raspberry Pi to automatically mount the external hard drive on boot. I'm sharing it here~

## Enter `sudo fdisk -l` to check the hard drive location

As you can see, the hard drive is located at /dev/sda1

## Normal mounting

We mount /dev/sda1 to the directory /opt/frp.v2fy.com/netdisc (the directory must exist and be empty)

```
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /opt/frp.v2fy.com/netdisc
```

Although the mount is successful at this point, the mount will become invalid after rebooting the Raspberry Pi

## Write mount information into the configuration file

- Add the following information to the end of the /etc/fstab file

```
UUID=8229-EF6C /opt/frp.v2fy.com/netdisc  exfat defaults 0 0
```

Partition device number to mount UUID=8229-EF6C

Mount point /opt/frp.v2fy.com/netdisc

File system type exfat

Mount options defaults

Backup (dump) 0

File system check 0

`sudo vim /etc/fstab`    

## Make configuration effective

```
sudo mount -a
```

- Check the mount status

```
df -h
```

## Reboot the system to check if it will auto-mount

```
sudo reboot
```

- Auto-mount successful after reboot

## Conclusion

The interesting thing about Linux is that the system is very transparent. As long as you do the right configuration, you can precisely achieve the desired effects. This is probably why enterprise users favor Linux!

Recently, I received some interesting comments that tinkering with Raspberry Pi is painful and lonely. In fact, tinkering with Raspberry Pi is more about dealing with Linux. While you're tinkering, you unknowingly learn a lot of professional Linux knowledge. It's both educational and fun - why not enjoy it?
