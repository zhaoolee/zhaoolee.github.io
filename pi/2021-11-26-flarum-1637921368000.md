Some time ago I released a [Building a Nest for Enthusiastic Geeks, A Complete Guide to Setting up a New Generation BBS Forum Site with Discourse in 30 Minutes, 2021](https://v2fy.com/p/2021-06-12-discourse-2021-1623477573000/) Discourse is very powerful, but it uses the Redis database, which is memory-intensive. For something like a BBS forum, you will later need a large amount of disk space to store images. Zhaoolee wanted to minimize operating costs as much as possible, so he ported Discourse to the Raspberry Pi. However, the official Discourse does not support the armv8 architecture CPU of the Raspberry Pi, and there are various issues with the necessary ruby packages on the Raspberry Pi. Therefore, I began to look for alternatives and finally found flarum!

![flarum](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1637921411004irrG4EMr.png)

flarum has 12K stars on GitHub, written in PHP, and is very lightweight.

![lightweight](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/16379214110968tddQjF6.png)

Uses mariadb database (a branch of Mysql), which is not memory-intensive;

The Chinese community is also very active.

Therefore, zhaoolee deployed flarum on the Raspberry Pi, opened it to the public network through internal network penetration, and bound a separate domain name~

![public](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1637921411021TkQCHBdG.png)

Below are the detailed deployment steps~

## Installing mariadb, a branch of Mysql, on the Raspberry Pi in Docker form

- Create a configuration file

```
mkdir /opt/docker-mariadb
cd /opt/docker-mariadb
touch stack.yml
```

- Run the following code to write content to the configuration file. The following configuration file has the default username as root and the default password as zhaoolee (for security replace **MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD** with a password you define).
```
sudo cat >/opt/docker-mariadb/stack.yml<<EOF
version: '3.1'

services:

  db:
    image: mariadb
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 3306:3306
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: zhaoolee

  adminer:
    image: adminer
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8090:8080
EOF
```

- Start the mariadb service

```
cd /opt/docker-mariadb/
sudo docker-compose -f stack.yml up -d
```

- Accessing port 8090 of Raspberry Pi

My Raspberry Pi local address is 192.168.50.223, visiting 192.168.50.223:8090 works.

sudo chmod 777 /etc/nginx/conf.d/flarum.v2fy.com.conf
```

- Write the following content into /etc/nginx/conf.d/flarum.v2fy.com.conf

```
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    root /opt/flarum/public;
    index index.php index.html index.htm;
    server_name flarum.v2fy.com;
    
    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.3-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    }
    
    location ~ /\. {
        deny all;
    }
    
    location = /favicon.ico {
        log_not_found off;

## Forward the Raspberry Pi service to the real flarum.v2fy.com through internal network penetration

Before reading this paragraph, please first understand the relevant knowledge of FRP internal network penetration. The FRP tutorial has been written in the first part of this series [《Raspberry Pi Dust Not Eat》Flash Ubuntu Server 20.04, bind a public domain name, provide HTTP service to the public network, SSH login service https://v2fy.com/p/2021-10-01-pi-server-1633066843000/](https://v2fy.com/p/2021-10-01-pi-server-1633066843000/)

- Step one: On the Raspberry Pi side, use the FRP client to forward the 80 port provided by nginx to the 8666 port of the server with a static IP

That is, add the following configuration in `/opt/frp_0.37.0_linux_arm64/frpc.ini`
```
[nginx-v2fy-com-8666]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 80
remote_port = 8666
```

After configuring, remember to restart frpc

- Step two: Log into the server and complete the configuration

We can see that port 8666 on the server side is already occupied by FRPS by using `lsof -i:8666`.
![Occupied](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1637921411266yH4tH484.png)

Resolve the domain name flarum.v2fy.com to the server IP

Create a new file `/etc/nginx/conf.d/flarum.v2fy.com.conf`

Following the tutorial [No dependencies! Using acme.sh to set up nginx multiple https certificates for automatic renewal, infinite renewal of https certificates https://v2fy.com/p/2021-06-27-nginx-https-1624774964000/](https://v2fy.com/p/2021-06-27-nginx-https-1624774964000/) to obtain an indefinitely renewable https certificate

- The final content of `/etc/nginx/conf.d/flarum.v2fy.com.conf` is

```
upstream flarum_v2fy_com { server 127.0.0.1:8666; }

server {
    server_name      flarum.v2fy.com;
    listen           80;

    rewrite ^(.*)$ https://$host$1 permanent;

}


server {

    listen       443 ssl http2;
    listen       [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name  flarum.v2fy.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://flarum_v2fy_com;
        proxy_set_header Host $host:443;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

    ssl_certificate "/etc/nginx/ssl/flarum.v2fy.com/fullchain.cer";
    ssl_certificate_key "/etc/nginx/ssl/flarum.v2fy.com/flarum.v2fy.com.key";
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:1m;
    ssl_session_timeout  10m;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    # Load configuration files for the default server block.

    error_page 404 /404.html;
        location = /40x.html {
    }

    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
    }
}
```

- Test and restart nginx
```
nginx -t
nginx -s reload
```

- Return to the Raspberry Pi, adjust the flarum configuration file for https

Open `/opt/flarum/config.php` change the url field to start with `//`

![url](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1637921412469cWjEZ46F.png)

After saving the file, restart php7.3-fpm

```
sudo /etc/init.d/php7.3-fpm restart
```

We remove the previously configured host information `192.168.50.233 flarum.v2fy.com`

Open https://flarum.v2fy.com with a browser, open developer tools
![Developer Tools](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/16379214124993c3ySHhj.png)

Refresh the page, you can see https://flarum.v2fy.com comes from a public network server IP

![From the Server](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1637921412698DjK4z2tN.png)

At this point, the flarum forum on the Raspberry Pi side has been successfully forwarded to the public internet!

## Support for Chinese

- Add a Chinese language pack

```
composer require flarum-lang/chinese-simplified
```

![Enter Admin Interface](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1637921412570mfANJJaf.png)

## Summary

Flarum and Discourse are both good BBS forum software. They are open source, free, user-friendly, and powerful. Flarum is more lightweight than Discourse, supporting ARMv8 CPUs. Combined with an external hard drive on a Raspberry Pi, it can be used for low-cost storage of a large amount of image resources and function as a long-term BBS forum.

Low-cost website construction is important. "Running on love" is unreliable, BBS site owners shouldn't have to spend a lot of money on building sites with no return, such BBS can hardly last long. This Raspberry Pi site building tutorial can greatly reduce the cost of building a site, with just one Raspberry Pi, mounting a large hard drive, you can solve large capacity storage and CPU memory issues. Just buy a small server with a public IP to keep the site running for a long time.

Finally, here's something I wrote at the end of the Discourse tutorial

```
This tutorial hopes to help friends who need to build a community.
The content pushed by platforms such as Zhihu, Baidu Tieba, Weibo, and public accounts is also problematic, and even frequently do harm for commercial interests.
If there are many self-built forums where people can speak, the speech will be more free, and the world's mainstream thoughts will be more open.
I hope that after 2021, there will be more enthusiastic bros and less extreme ideological thoughts.
```
