title: Raspberry Pi: Don't Collect Dust Issue 2 Future Technology of Cloud Storage - Adding SMB Services and Achieving Intranet Penetration for File Sharing Across All Devices
categories:
- Raspberry Pi: Don't Collect Dust / Use Pi
---

After the efforts of the previous issue, we have already built a Raspberry Pi home server with intranet penetration; "Raspberry Pi: Don't Collect Dust" Install Ubuntu Server 20.04, bind public domain names, provide HTTP service to the public internet, SSH login service https://v2fy.com/p/2021-10-01-pi-server-1633066843000/



In this issue, zhaoolee will add new functionality to the Raspberry Pi by mounting a large capacity hard drive to it, to achieve file sharing among all devices within the local network, also known as an smb server;



After the smb local area network server is set up, I also configured intranet penetration, so that any computer on the public internet can access the large capacity hard drive mounted on the home Raspberry Pi with a username and password.



Why choose the smb protocol?



The advantage of smb is its good compatibility. It is widely supported across various platforms, including easy mounting access on Windows, Linux, macOS, etc. In addition, smb is also the default supported protocol by various TVs and TV boxes, which allows remote playback of movies, music, and pictures via smb.




## Create a Directory `/*examples*/`

```
sudo mkdir /opt/smb
sudo chmod -R 777 /opt/smb
```

## Install smb Service

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install samba -y
```

## Create smb Password File `/*examples*/`

```
sudo touch /etc/samba/smbpasswd
```

## Add User and Set Password

```
sudo smbpasswd -a ubuntu
```

If you need to change the password, just execute `sudo smbpasswd -a ubuntu` again;



Here, "ubuntu" is the username, please replace it with your actual username, as appropriate;



## Add the following configuration in `/etc/samba/smb.conf`


```
[ubuntu]
   comment = ubuntu
   path = /opt/smb
   writable = yes
   valid user = ubuntu
   available = yes
   create mask = 0777
   directory mask = 0777
   public = yes
```

## SMB Capacity Expansion

I have a 1TB hard drive that I plan to use as storage space for SMB;

Firstly, we need to ensure the Raspberry Pi is adequately powered. The power supply should be at least 5V 3000mA to ensure the Pi won't crash after connecting a large capacity hard drive via USB.

- Create a new folder `1tb` under `/opt/smb/`, to use as the mount point

```
sudo mkdir  /opt/smb/1tb
sudo chmod 777 -R  /opt/smb/1tb
```

- Connect the hard drive and check if it is successfully connected

```
sudo fdisk -l
```

![Check if the hard drive is successfully connected](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/16332317012478HZkGx04.png)

We can see that the device mount point is `/dev/sda1`

- Mount the hard drive

```
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /opt/smb/1tb
sudo chmod 777 -R  /opt/smb/1tb
```

- Check the mount effect

You can add, delete, modify, and check new hard drive content through the 1tb folder.

## How to expose the SMB service to the public network?

The port provided by the SMB service on Raspberry Pi is 445. The best solution is to map the 445 port of the Raspberry Pi to the 445 port of a public network server. However, since I am using Alibaba Cloud, and they have restrictions on port 445, I had to map the Raspberry Pi's port 445 to the public server's port 44501.

The configuration is very simple (if you don't know what an FRP client configuration file is, please check the previous issue; the URL for the previous issue is at the start of this document).

![Client Configuration File](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/16332317006468SMH8s0C.png)

```
[smb-frp-v2fy-com-44501]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 445
remote_port = 44501
```

- Connect to the public network mapped SMB service

![Connect to the public network mapped SMB service](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/16332316997830KA55BE2.png)

- Take note to use port 44501

![Note to write 44501 port](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633231700328itm5seaS.png)

- Connection successful

![Connection Successful](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633231700851thm2Hjda.png)

After completing the port 44501 mapping, I discovered a frustrating issue with Windows: Windows does not allow custom ports, which means it can only use port 445...

```bash
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=127.0.0.1 listenport=445 connectaddress=frp.v2fy.com connectport=44501

netsh interface portproxy show all
```
- Run the following commands with elevated privileges in the command prompt as an administrator

With that, the configuration is successful!

## Summary

With the SMB service, file sharing between devices becomes very simple! In 2021, virtually all cloud storage resources in China are subject to scrutiny, with Baidu Cloud being notorious for indiscriminate bans without giving any explanations. However, through the SMB service set up with the Raspberry Pi's internal network penetration, which supports a broad range of features, does not require the installation of any client software, and has account password control, it's hailed as the future technology of cloud storage.
