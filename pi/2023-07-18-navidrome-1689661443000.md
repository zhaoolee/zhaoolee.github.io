title: "Raspberry Pi Doesn't Collect Dust" Issue 19 Setting Up Navidrome Private Music Server on Raspberry Pi with Lyric Display Support
categories:
- Raspberry Pi Doesn't Collect Dust / Use Pi
---

In 2023, the prices of domestic hard drives are truly economical, and due to copyright disputes, we cannot get the songs we want to listen to from a single platform. In this issue, we will set up a Navidrome private music server on Raspberry Pi with support for lyric display. (Although Jellyfin also supports managing songs, it doesn't support displaying lyrics, and I think lyric display is an essential feature, which is why I chose Navidrome.)



This article is the 19th issue of the "Raspberry Pi Doesn't Collect Dust" series. It involves setting up Docker, Samba, and FRP services; detailed tutorials have been published in earlier chapters. If you encounter any difficulties, please check github.com/zhaoolee/pi




## Install and Run Navidrome on Raspberry Pi via Docker Compose


```
# Create data directory
mkdir -p /opt/navidrome/data
# Create music directory
mkdir /opt/navidrome/music
# Set permissions
chmod 777 -R  /opt/navidrome
# Enter the Navidrome directory
cd /opt/navidrome
# Create a docker-compose.yml file
touch docker-compose.yml
# Set docker-compose.yml file permissions 
chmod 777 docker-compose.yml
```

Write the following content into `docker-compose.yml`



```
version: "3"
services:
  navidrome:
    image: deluan/navidrome:latest
    user: 1000:1000 # should be owner of volumes
    ports:
      - "4533:4533"
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      # Optional: put your config customization options here. Examples:
      ND_SCANSCHEDULE: 1h
      ND_LOGLEVEL: info  
      ND_SESSIONTIMEOUT: 24h
      ND_BASEURL: ""
    volumes:
      - "/opt/navidrome/data:/data"
      - "/opt/navidrome/music:/music:ro"
```

Command-line version:


```
sudo bash -c 'cat > /opt/navidrome/docker-compose.yml' <<-'EOF'
version: "3"
services:
  navidrome:
    image: deluan/navidrome:latest
    user: 1000:1000 # should be owner of volumes
    ports:
      - "4533:4533"
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      # Optional: put your config customization options here. Examples:
      ND_SCANSCHEDULE: 1h
      ND_LOGLEVEL: info  
      ND_SESSIONTIMEOUT: 24h
      ND_BASEURL: ""
    volumes:
      - "/opt/navidrome/data:/data"
      - "/opt/navidrome/music:/music:ro"
EOF
```

Start Navidrome



```
cd /opt/navidrome
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

Currently, we haven't placed any resources in `/opt/navidrome/music`, so there is nothing there. Next, we will download some resources from QQ Music.




## Download MP3 songs and corresponding LRC lyric files from QQ Music

QQ Music is chosen here because it has a more comprehensive song collection and it's more convenient for downloads. It's acceptable to download resources from the internet or use shared resources from others.

After the download is complete, right-click to browse the local file



![image-20230718152212353](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1689664932744Ztz0Yj3t.png)

We can see the downloaded files

## Copy the files to the desktop and unlock the MP3 files

After copying the above two files to the desktop, open https://demo.unlock-music.dev/ and drag and drop the MP3 file into the webpage's dashed area to unlock it



![image-20230718152747657](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1689665268130aAh1JCZ7.png)

Download the successfully unlocked MP3 file

## Use FRP for Internal Network Penetration

Add the following configuration in the Raspberry Pi's frpc.ini configuration file

```
[navidrome-frp-v2fy-com-4533]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 4533
remote_port = 4533
```

## Now You Can Access Your Private Music Service Over the Internet

After restarting the Raspberry Pi's frpc, Navidrome's working port 4533 will be mapped to the cloud server, and we can access the Navidrome service of the Raspberry Pi from the external network.

## Conclusion

Recently, when opening music apps, the songs pushed are really not to my taste, and I kind of miss the old-fashioned mp3 players. Although the number of songs is limited, each one is nice to listen to, each one familiar. This led to the idea of setting up a private music server, and after a round of tinkering, the experience turned out to be quite good.
