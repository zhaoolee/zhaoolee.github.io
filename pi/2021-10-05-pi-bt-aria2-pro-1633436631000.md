Early on, zhaoolee wanted to set up a personal download station. Taking advantage of the ample time over the National Day holiday this year, I established the download station on a Raspberry Pi and opened it to the public; from anywhere, I can simply submit download tasks through a webpage, and the Raspberry Pi at my home will automatically download the resources I need to my hard drive, day and night non-stop. This article provides detailed building steps, and at the end, there are 6 highly praised quality torrent sites recommended. 



This article mainly introduces the installation method for Aria2 Pro.

## First, install Docker



- Install docker on Ubuntu 20.04 

```
sudo apt update

sudo apt install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release -y

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

sudo apt update

sudo apt install docker-ce=5:20.10.8~3-0~ubuntu-focal docker-ce-cli=5:20.10.9~3-0~ubuntu-focal containerd.io=1.4.11-1 -y
```

- Install docker on Ubuntu 22.04

```
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
  

sudo apt-get update





sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin -y
```





## Install Docker Compose

```
sudo curl -L --fail https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxserver/docker-docker-compose/master/run.sh -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

sudo docker-compose --version
```
The Raspberry Pi processor is armv8, for which there is no directly installable version, so here we use the Docker version of docker-compose.

## Install aria2 pro


```
sudo mkdir /opt/aria2-pro
sudo chmod 777 -R /opt/aria2-pro
cd  /opt/aria2-pro
wget git.io/aria2-pro.yml

```

![aria2-pro-yml](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/163343668411278DKafGp.png)

- Content of aria2-pro.yml

```
version: "3.8"

services:

  Aria2-Pro:
    container_name: aria2-pro
    image: p3terx/aria2-pro
    environment:

# If you use host network mode, then no port mapping is required.
# This is the easiest way to use IPv6 networks.
    network_mode: host
#    network_mode: bridge
```
# ports:
# - 6800:6800
# - 6888:6888
# - 6888:6888/udp
    restart: unless-stopped
# Since Aria2 will continue to generate logs, limit the log size to 1M to prevent your hard disk from running out of space.
    logging:
      driver: json-file
      options:
        max-size: 1m

# AriaNg is just a static web page, usually you only need to deploy on a single host.
  AriaNg:
    container_name: ariang
    image: p3terx/ariang
    command: --port 6880 --ipv6
    network_mode: host
#    network_mode: bridge
#    ports:
#      - 6880:6880
    restart: unless-stopped
    logging:
      driver: json-file
      options:
        max-size: 1m

- Execute

```
cd /opt/aria2-pro
sudo docker-compose -f aria2-pro.yml up -d
```

## Access the 6880 port of the IP
```
http://192.168.50.223:6880/
```
- Seeing authentication failed

![Authentication Failed](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/163343668377213YRHFpn.png)

In our aria2-pro.yml file earlier, there was a field named RPC_SECRET, with the default value being P3TERX

Entering P3TERX on the page will allow us to pass authentication


![Enter the Authentication Password](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633436683894QP08CPrb.png)

- If you want to change the password, please modify the RPC_SECRET field directly in aria2-pro.yml

After saving the aria2-pro.yml file, run ` sudo docker-compose -f aria2-pro.yml up -d` again to reboot

![image.png](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633436683909FpAA6CAy.png)

After restarting the container, enter the web page, reset the password, and refresh the page to proceed.

## Change the download file location

With the increase in the number of resources I download, the default SD card space is not enough, I suggest putting the download location on an external hard drive 

![External Hard Drive](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633436683892E1d45A8P.png)

To prevent failure, set the file allocation method to prealloc

## How to download torrent files?

![Download Torrent Files](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633436683889kYJWft8D.gif)

Directly open the location of the torrent page on the Web page to start the download!

## The benefits of downloading with Raspberry Pi

- Raspberry Pi has very low power consumption and stable and non-crashing downloads; after you create a new task, you can get a 24-hour download effect without needing your computer to be turned on all the time.

- aria2 is an absolute tool; aria2 will not, like Xunlei, give a torrent and say there are copyright issues and not allow downloads.

- aria2 will not throttle and will constantly accelerate; aria2 will seed while downloading, and as time goes on, download speed will constantly improve.

## Map ports 6800 and 6880 to the public network to build a personal download platform

- First, open ports 6800 and 6880 on the cloud server to allow external requests;

![Open](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/16334366838931QTGjamp.png)

- Then start two port forwarding on the frpc end

If you don’t understand frpc, refer to "《Raspberry Pi Does Not Collect Dust》Flash Ubuntu Server 20.04, Bind Public Network Domain Name, Provide Http Service to the Public Network, SSH Login Service https://v2fy.com/p/2021-10-01-pi-server-1633066843000/ "

![frp.v2fy.com-6800](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1633436683503nmWFHFZG.png)

- With a public network address, we can view download progress in real-time on mobile devices, and add new download tasks~

## Conclusion

In 2021, when it comes to searching for resources, one often encounters some puzzling behaviors; video platforms may arbitrarily take down series, or present an incomplete version, causing a great decline in viewing experience. The audience has paid, yet has to endure. Putting some video resources in paid cloud drives can be mysteriously deleted and never recovered; professional downloading tools like Xunlei will prohibit users from downloading certain resources due to copyright issues, even if you are an annual member.

All sorts of software have gone from perpetual purchase to major version fees, to annual fees, then to monthly fees, and finally to subscription-based models, costing consumers more and more money for increasingly poor services.

Whether it's video resources or software, they are just data, and their copying costs are almost zero. Vendors cry out every day for the maintenance of copyright but never pay attention to the experience of consumers.

I believe that whether it's videos or software, there should be a cap on the number of sales. If a good work can break even with 100,000 sales, then there should be no further profits after 300,000 sales. The government should impose higher taxes on sales after 300,000 as an income surplus, turning it into funds for public infrastructure, so that good works can benefit society rather than becoming a tool for amassing wealth.

Downloading resources efficiently from the internet and obtaining complete, high-quality works is a gift the internet has given to netizens. We should not discard this gift. BitTorrent seeds are a technology that appeared more than a decade ago; we upload as we download, everyone for each other. Standing in the year 2021, the design of BitTorrent seeds still leads the times, it has multiple nodes, the more nodes there are, the higher the transmission efficiency. The internet becomes increasingly open because of the existence of BitTorrent.
