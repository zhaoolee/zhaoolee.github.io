title: "Raspberry Pi No Dust" Issue 23 Setting Up a Personal Photography Site on a Raspberry Pi
categories:

Recently, zhaoolee bought a Sony ZV1 M2, a compact camera that is small enough to fit in a pocket, greatly increasing the speed of shooting. To showcase these photos, this issue will cover setting up a photography website that runs on a Raspberry Pi and supports external access.

One of the benefits of using a Raspberry Pi for storage is that space is cheap; a 1TB mechanical hard drive only costs a few dozen bucks. If you access the website from a home intranet, even super-large originals can be opened at high speed.

With the Pi set up for intranet penetration, the website can also be opened to the internet.

The final result https://photography.v2fy.com/

Clicking on the image displays it in large format. In widescreen mode, if the original image retains shooting parameters, these will be displayed in the lower-left corner.

The photography website is based on the open-source Github project https://github.com/rampatra/photography, which supports running `gulp resize` to crop photography pictures in one click. After cropping, images with a width of 1024px as originals are placed into the `images/full` folder, and images with a width of 512px are used as thumbnails and put into the `images/thumbs` folder.

However, I want the `images/full` to contain the most original pictures. After running `gulp resize`, it generates thumbnails based on images in `images/full` and puts them into `images/thumbs`. So I rewrote this resize logic, and the code is stored at https://github.com/zhaoolee/photography

The original open-source project defaults to using Github Actions for build and Github Pages for hosting static pages, completing the release. However, in China, the pictures resources of Github Pages are blocked by the unique network situation.

To deal with this unique network environment, I transformed the project: it is still hosted on Github, but the static website is built locally. The static site resources, after building, are sent to a specific folder on the Raspberry Pi via rsync, completing the deployment. At the same time, the project resources are published to a Github repository as a backup.

Additionally, I made some optimizations. By placing images in the fulls folder, preview images can be automatically generated in real-time and displayed on the web page immediately, whereas the original version required manually running `gulp resize`.

In practice, you just need to put the images in the `images/fulls` folder and run `npm run push`, which completes the release and creates a backup on Github.

## Getting the Project, Installing Dependencies

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/zhaoolee/photography.git
cd photography
bundle install
npm install
```

## Running the Project

```
npm run dev
```

Opening `http://127.0.0.1:4000` in a browser will display zhaoolee's photography website resources. Delete the image resources inside `images/fulls` and `images/thumbs`, put your own pictures in `images/fulls`, and refresh your browser to see the final effect.

## Generating Static Website

```
npm run build
```

After running the command above, the website's necessary resources will be generated in the root directory's `_site` folder.

As long as the contents of `_site` are hosted on the Raspberry Pi's Nginx, it can be accessed from the intranet.

Create a directory in Nginx to store the static content of `_site`

```
sudo mkdir /usr/share/nginx/photography.v2fy.com
sudo chown www-data:www-data /usr/share/nginx/photography.v2fy.com
```

Since the default user for Nginx is `www-data`, we create a folder for Nginx to use that belongs to `www-data`.

![image-20231018151304146](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1697613184538kr7XY2cf.png)

Create a file ending in `.conf` in the `etc/nginx/conf.d` directory on the Raspberry Pi, such as `photography.v2fy.com.conf`, and add the following content

```
server {
    listen 8084;
    server_name photography.v2fy.com 127.0.0.1  192.168.50.10;

    location / {
        root /usr/share/nginx/photography.v2fy.com;
        index index.html index.htm;
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    error_page 404 /404.html;
    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    }
}
```

Then use rsync to transfer the contents of `_site` to `/usr/share/nginx/photography.v2fy.com`, for example, with the command

```
rsync -avvz --update --no-perms --chown=www-data:www-data --delete ./_site/  root@frp:/usr/share/nginx/photography.v2fy.com/
```
After the transfer is complete, restart nginx


```
sudo nginx -t
sudo nginx -s reload
```

We can now access the film and television site using the internal network


![image-20231018151723132](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1697613443960ysnTQj3i.png)

Add the following configuration to the frpc.ini on the Raspberry Pi, mapping local port 8084 to port 8084 on the cloud server


```
[photography]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 8084
remote_port = 8084
```

On the server side, add the Nginx configuration rule file `/etc/nginx/conf.d/photography.v2fy.com.conf`


```
upstream photography_v2fy_com { server 127.0.0.1:8084; }

server {
    server_name      photography.v2fy.com;
    listen           80;

    #rewrite ^(.*)$ https://$host$1 permanent;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://photography_v2fy_com;
        proxy_set_header Host $host:80;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}

server {
    listen       443 ssl http2;
    listen       [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name  photography.v2fy.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://photography_v2fy_com;
        proxy_set_header Host $host:443;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

    ssl_certificate "/etc/nginx/ssl/photography.v2fy.com/fullchain.cer";
    ssl_certificate_key "/etc/nginx/ssl/photography.v2fy.com/photography.v2fy.com.key";
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:1m;
    ssl_session_timeout  10m;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    # Load configuration files for the default server block.

    error_page 404 /404.html;
        location = /40x.html {
    }

    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
    }
}
```
Once the certificate is configured, restart the server Nginx!

## Summary


As mobile photography becomes stronger and camera manufacturers continue to evolve, consumersâ€™ bulk purchases can also deflate research and development costs. We can buy great cameras at very low prices and enjoy the fun of photography. The Raspberry Pi photography website allows us to showcase our work on the Internet at an extremely low cost.


If you are a person who loves photography, having an independent photography website can add a professional touch to your hobby. Persisting in updating your own photography website and learning about photography, as well as reviewing past photos, can lead to deeper contemplation about photography.
