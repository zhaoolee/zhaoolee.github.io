Recently, an old MacBook Pro was repurposed by me as a media decoding server, ["Raspberry Pi Never Gathers Dust" Issue 17: Raspberry Pi with a better-performing spare notebook to build an open-source, free jellyfin private cinema](https://v2fy.com/p/2023-06-10-jellyfin-1686388142000/), I wanted to access this MacBook Pro via remote desktop and discovered that although Mac natively supports VNC connections, the experience was often plagued with screen tearing. Consequently, I found an open-source remote desktop program called rustdesk and deployed its service on a Raspberry Pi, achieving silky smooth access for devices on the local network, with direct access to macOS for devices on external networks via internal network penetration.

rustdesk's GitHub open source address https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk

## Advantages of rustdesk {/*advantages-of-rustdesk*/}

- Open source, supports private deployment
- No limit on connection numbers
- Supports Windows, macOS, Linux; one solution for remote control
- Through internal network mapping, you can remotely control internal network devices anytime, anywhere
- Smooth and fluid access within the intranet, automatic switching of internal and external network traffic


## Deploying rustdesk on Raspberry Pi, achieving LAN Windows control over macOS 

```
# Create a mount directory
mkdir -p /opt/rustdesk
chmod 755 -R /opt/rustdesk
# Create a directory for storing docker-compose.yml
mkdir -p /opt/rustdesk-docker-compose-yml
chmod 755 -R /opt/rustdesk-docker-compose-yml
# Create docker-compose.yml
touch /opt/rustdesk-docker-compose-yml/docker-compose.yml 
```

Enter the configuration content in `docker-compose.yml`

```git
cat << 'EOF' > /opt/rustdesk-docker-compose-yml/docker-compose.yml
version: '3'

networks:
  rustdesk-net:
    external: false

services:
  hbbs:
    container_name: hbbs
    ports:
      - 21115:21115
      - 21116:21116
      - 21116:21116/udp
      - 21118:21118
    image: rustdesk/rustdesk-server:latest
    command: hbbs -r rustdesk.example.com:21117
    volumes:
      - /opt/rustdesk:/root
    networks:
      - rustdesk-net
    depends_on:
      - hbbr
    restart: unless-stopped

  hbbr:
    container_name: hbbr
    ports:
      - 21117:21117
      - 21119:21119
    image: rustdesk/rustdesk-server:latest
    command: hbbr
    volumes:
      - /opt/rustdesk:/root
    networks:
      - rustdesk-net
    restart: unless-stopped
EOF
```

- Start the service 

```
cd /opt/rustdesk-docker-compose-yml/
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

My Raspberry Pi's LAN IP is `192.168.50.10`, inputting `192.168.50.10` into the rustdesk client is sufficient (both the initiating and controlled endpoints need to download and install the rustdesk client, and configure the ID Server), rustdesk client download address https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/releases

![image-20230912101426079](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1694484866814RTGS03DK.png)

After the client is saved, it will display that the configuration is successful

![image-20230912101459339](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1694484900078DRZ176RF.png)

Once the configuration is complete, we can use the rustdesk service running on the Raspberry Pi to remotely control devices within the local area network

The controlled host's ID won't change (unless the user actively changes it), but the password often changes randomly. If you want to use a fixed password, you can set it directly as shown below

Display settings can be customized. The latency within the LAN can be 5ms, controlling macOS with Windows is very smooth and responsive

One small pitfall I encountered: If the MacBook is not connected to an external display and the lid is closed, rustdesk often disconnects automatically every few seconds. If you also want to control a MacBook, please don't close the lid.


## Enabling the rustdesk service on your home Raspberry Pi to support external network access

Accessing from external networks is also quite simple, just a few port mappings with frp will do 

![image-20230912111138990](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1694488300187hfGn57Qt.png)

- Add the following configuration to the frpc.ini file on the Raspberry Pi, and restart frpc to take effect

```
[rustdesk-tcp-21115]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 21115
remote_port = 21115
```
```markdown
[rustdesk-tcp-21116]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 21116
remote_port = 21116

[rustdesk-udp-21116]
type = udp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 21116
remote_port = 21116

[rustdesk-tcp-21117]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 21117
remote_port = 21117

[rustdesk-tcp-21118]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 21118
remote_port = 21118

[rustdesk-tcp-21119]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 21119
remote_port = 21119
```

If you want **local host A** to be able to receive external connections, we need to set the ID server of **local host A** to the cloud server's IP (the cloud server's IP is a public IP, it will receive requests and forward them to the Raspberry Pi).

Of course, the host that initiates control from the external network also needs to set the external IP to start control.

![image-20230912135153485](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1694497914409R6QyH826.png)

If the **control initiator** is in a home intranet environment, the **ID server** can be set to the Raspberry Pi's intranet IP, or it can be set to the **cloud server's public IP**.

## Why not just run the rustdesk service on the server instead of on the Raspberry Pi?

Rustdesk has two services, hbbs responsible for signature verification and hbbr responsible for forwarding data packets generated from remote control.

![170487506-8ef1f025-ad42-47f9-8d82-b49d0ec759ad](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1694498376154G7B1thhS.png)

In the settings interface, we only filled in the hbbs information (ID server), without filling in the hbbr information; hbbr will then automatically determine whether to use public network traffic.

If our **controlled host** and the **host initiating control** are both on an intranet, the two will directly use intranet traffic, resulting in an incredibly smooth experience.

Of course, as soon as either the controlling end or the controlled end leaves the intranet, they will automatically switch to using cloud server forwarding traffic.

![image-20230912141949102](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/16944995908258GRFpifA.png)

## So How Should the ID Server be Filled?

As long as it's an external network, both the controlling and the controlled ends should fill in the external IP!

If in an intranet, both ends can still fill in the external IP; (If both the controlled and controlling devices are on the intranet, they will automatically use intranet traffic, which is very smooth).

If a device is only to be connected by devices on the intranet, then fill in the intranet IP!

(Intranet IP refers to the Raspberry Pi IP, external IP refers to the cloud server IP)

## Summary

I've seen some YouTubers turn their Mac minis into home servers, but due to macOS's poor optimization of the VNC protocol, it results in screen tearing. Thus, they can only reluctantly use ssh to connect to the server, but I feel that giving up the smooth animations of macOS is too much of a shame. That's why the Raspberry Pi running the open-source rustdesk scheme came up.

Although there are solutions like Teamviewer, AnyDesk, Sunflower, etc., none of them can achieve a silky-smooth remote desktop experience on the intranet.

This Raspberry Pi rustdesk solution ensures a silky-smooth remote desktop experience on the intranet and a smooth one on the external network. Even without a Raspberry Pi, you can run the rustdesk server through a virtual machine, which brings new life to an old MacBook.
