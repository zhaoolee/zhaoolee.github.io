Recently, after installing several Docker images on my Raspberry Pi, the 16GB SD card has become clearly insufficient. So, I decided to expand the capacity. To avoid starting from scratch with a new system, I found a perfect way to clone the 16GB SD card, copying it exactly as is to a 64GB card. Here are the detailed steps~

## Initial Preparation

- A Windows computer capable of reading and writing two SD cards simultaneously
- Software DiskGenius Green version URL: `https://frp.v2fy.com/%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E6%81%A2%E5%A4%8D%E8%BD%AF%E4%BB%B6DiskGenius/DiskGenius.zip`

## Check the Capacity of the Old SD Card on the Raspberry Pi

`sudo fdisk -l`

## Turn off the Raspberry Pi

```
poweroff
```

After the ssh disconnects, wait for the Raspberry Pi lights to turn red, turn off the power, and remove the SD card.

## Start DiskGenius

## Summary

The Raspberry Pi 4B can be equipped with 8GB memory, and pairing it with a large capacity SD card seems reasonable. If your Raspberry Pi's SD card space is no longer sufficient, feel free to use the method provided in this article to expand it. It really is time-saving and effortless. If you wish to regularly back up your Raspberry Pi SD card, the method in this article is also an excellent choice.

If you have multiple Raspberry Pi of the same model, cloning the old SD card to the SD cards of other Raspberry Pis using the method in this article can also save a lot of Raspberry Pi configuration time.
