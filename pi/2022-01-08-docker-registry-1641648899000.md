title: "Raspberry Pi No Dust" Issue 15 Setting Up a Private Docker Registry with Raspberry Pi and Configuring Public Network Access Authentication
categories:

A few days ago, I toyed with a k8s cluster using 3 Raspberry Pis and successfully provided services to the public network. The tutorial can be found at ["Raspberry Pi No Dust" Issue #14: Building a k8s Cluster with Raspberry Pi 4B](https://v2fy.com/p/2022-01-05-k8s-pi-1641393748000/). To master containerized management with k8s, you first need a reliable Docker repository to store images. Although the official Docker repository at https://hub.docker.com/ is very stable, it does not offer free storage for private images.

This article mainly involves how to upload Docker images to the official repository (hub.docker.com), and how to use a Raspberry Pi to create a private Docker repository with password authentication and make it accessible to the public network.

## How to Upload Docker Images to the Official Repository

Step one: Register a user account at https://hub.docker.com/, my username is zhaoolee, which will be used later.

Step two: Write some test code and package it, you can use the code I've written at https://github.com/zhaoolee/pi-k8s-test.

Step three: Build (package) the image via the command line. Enter the code directory and enter the following command to build the image in the directory where Dockerfile is located. In the following commands, zhaoolee is the username, pi-k8s-test is the image name, and the image version is 002. Modify the version number each time you update the image; the version number is generally incremental and facilitates distinction later on.


```
sudo docker build -t zhaoolee/pi-k8s-test:002 . --no-cache
```

> Note: Strictly speaking, `zhaoolee/pi-k8s-test:002` should be `docker.io/zhaoolee/pi-k8s-test:002`. However, `docker.io` is the default official image download address, so it can be omitted.

The process of Docker packaging images often requires downloading dependency packages online. To ensure the smoothness of the packaging, the computer responsible for packaging images should ideally support scientific internet access. Zhaoolee has implemented scientific internet access on the router above the Raspberry Pi cluster, making the Raspberry Pis excellent computers for packaging Docker images.

Step four: Authenticate the user login for https://hub.docker.com/ via the command line.


```
docker login
```

![Enter username and password](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1641648974333zy8D7J4w.png)

Step five: Push the image.


```
sudo docker push zhaoolee/pi-k8s-test:002
```

![Push successful](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1641648974508d3a8EsP4.png)

How to pull images from a remote source?

```
sudo docker pull zhaoolee/pi-k8s-test:002
```

If we need to build our image repository, the official Docker also provides a reliable method.

## Setting Up a Personal Image Repository on Raspberry Pi with an Official Docker Image

Original image repository address: https://hub.docker.com/_/registry

Currently, the fixed IP of the Raspberry Pi is 192.168.50.10, and the private image repository service will run on port 5000. Since Docker defaults to using the more secure https protocol, in order for the Docker on the Raspberry Pi to successfully push images to 192.168.50.10:5000, we need to write the `insecure-registries` configuration information in the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file, which allows the use of the private repository at 192.168.50.10:5000.


```
{
  "insecure-registries" : [ "192.168.50.10:5000" ]
}
```

Then restart Docker-related services to make `insecure-registries` take effect.

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

If we want to push services from other computers within the(internal) network to 192.168.50.10:5000, we also need to configure the Docker client with `insecure-registries` and restart Docker to take effect. Since `insecure-registries` are an array, we can add multiple private repositories without https authentication.


- Create a folder for storing images.

```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/dr/registry
sudo touch /opt/dr/docker-compose.yml
sudo chmod 777 -R /opt/dr/
```

Enter the following content in the `/opt/dr/docker-compose.yml` file.

```
registry:
  restart: always
  image: registry:2
  ports:
    - 5000:5000
  environment:
    REGISTRY_HTTP_ADDR: 0.0.0.0:5000
  volumes:
    - /opt/dr/registry:/var/lib/registry
```

Start the service.

```
cd /opt/dr
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

- Pull `zhaoolee/pi-k8s-test:002` from the official repository and transfer it to the Raspberry Pi private repository.

```
sudo docker pull zhaoolee/pi-k8s-test:002
sudo docker tag zhaoolee/pi-k8s-test:002 192.168.50.10:5000/zhaoolee/pi-k8s-test:002
sudo docker push 192.168.50.10:5000/zhaoolee/pi-k8s-test:002
```

The key step to pushing to a private repository is tagging correctly, that is, adding the local private repository IP and port in front of the username zhaoolee. If we are packaging images on the Raspberry Pi, we can directly tag during the build stage to save time and effort.

## Making the Raspberry Pi Docker Private Repository Service Accessible to the Public Network

On the server side, we apply for a https certificate for registry.v2fy.com and redirect all requests pointing to `docker.v2fy.com` through FRP to the 5000 port of the Raspberry Pi.
When exposing services to the public network, one must consider the issue of user login authentication. To avoid affecting the existing Docker registry service on the Raspberry Pi, we will handle user authentication on the public network server's Nginx side, storing user authentication information in `/opt/dr/auth/htpasswd` on the public network server.

Run the following on the public network server:

```
htpasswd /opt/dr/auth/htpasswd zhaoolee
```

![Enter password](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1641648975162ckJhJZYw.png)

The username and password have been successfully stored in `/opt/dr/auth/htpasswd`.

![Username and password](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1641648975460JQYx0esf.png)

Running the same username again can reset the password.

![Reset password](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1641648975602PhZ8ZH3h.png)

Run `htpasswd /opt/dr/auth/htpasswd username` to create more users. To remove a user, simply delete the corresponding line for the username!

Next, add an Nginx configuration file on the public network server. For convenience, my configuration file location and name are `/etc/nginx/conf.d/registry.v2fy.com.conf`, with the content being:

```nginx
upstream registry_v2fy_com { server 127.0.0.1:5000; }

server {
    server_name      registry.v2fy.com;
    listen       80;
    listen       [::]:80;
    rewrite ^(.*)$ https://$host$1 permanent;
}

server {
    listen       443 ssl http2;
    listen       [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name  registry.v2fy.com;

    location / {
        auth_basic  "Please Input username/password";
        auth_basic_user_file     /opt/dr/auth/htpasswd;
        proxy_pass http://registry_v2fy_com;
        proxy_set_header Host $host:443;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

    ssl_certificate "/etc/nginx/ssl/registry.v2fy.com/fullchain.cer";
    ssl_certificate_key "/etc/nginx/ssl/registry.v2fy.com/registry.v2fy.com.key";
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:1m;
    ssl_session_timeout  10m;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    # Load configuration files for the default server block.
    include /etc/nginx/default.d/*.conf;

    error_page 404 /404.html;
        location = /40x.html {
    }

    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
    }
}
```

The two special lines of configuration above are auth_basic (authentication prompt phrase) and auth_basic_user_file (location where the username and password are stored).

```
auth_basic "Please Input username/password";
auth_basic_user_file /opt/dr/auth/htpasswd;
```

## Pull Image Test

```
# Login
sudo docker login registry.v2fy.com
# Logout
sudo docker logout registry.v2fy.com
```

## Summary

After tinkering with the Raspberry Pi, we finally have our own Docker private repository, which supports access via HTTPS on the public network and user permission management.

The combination of Docker repositories with K8s allows ordinary people with a few Raspberry Pis to form their own development and release workflows, which are efficient and stable. The continuous progress of open-source technologies allows people who love the internet to publish their creativity to the world at increasingly lower costs, and to provide stable services.
