TiddlyWiki is a "non-linear personal web notebook" comprising of javascript, CSS styles, and HTML syntax to form an html document, which allows users to directly edit the page content using wiki syntax in a browser. It is very suitable for personal thoughts recording, diary keeping, memorandums, knowledge management, and it can also be used to create task lists, plan and manage projects, etc.

This article provides a method to deploy TiddlyWiki on Raspberry Pi, make it accessible over the public internet, complete the application and installation of HTTPS certificates, and set up visitor and administrator identities.

The program we use this time comes from [https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5), here is the deployment installation tutorial~

## Install Node.js

Download Node.js and extract it
```
cd /opt/
sudo wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.18.0/node-v14.18.0-linux-arm64.tar.xz
sudo tar xvf node-v14.18.0-linux-arm64.tar.xz
```

Add Node.js to the environment variables (if you use zsh, replace bashrc with zshrc in the following commands~)

```
sudo echo "export NODE_HOME=/opt/node-v14.18.0-linux-arm64" >> ~/.bashrc
sudo echo "export PATH=\$NODE_HOME/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Check the Node.js installation location and version

```
which node
node -v
```

```
tiddlywiki --version
```
![Check installed version](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1637997881904YQKtX4Gt.png)


## Create a Wiki

- Initialize the Wiki folder

```
cd /opt
tiddlywiki wiki --init server
```

![wiki](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1637997881916rFtAQyRA.png)

After successful initialization, a tiddlywiki.info file will appear in the `/opt/wiki` folder

- Start the service

```
cd /opt
tiddlywiki wiki --listen host=0.0.0.0  port=8998
```

![Start Service](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1637997881910chb8NxjQ.png)

The internal IP of my Raspberry Pi is 192.168.50.223 and the running port of tiddlywiki is 8998. I only need to visit 192.168.50.223:8998 to see the running effect

## Use pm2 to guard the tiddlywiki process and set it to run at startup

- First install pm2

```
npm install -g pm2
pm2 -v
```

- Set up the tiddlywiki run script

```
echo 'tiddlywiki /opt/wiki --listen host=0.0.0.0  port=8998' > /opt/start_tiddlywiki.sh
```

- Run tiddlywiki under the watch of pm2

```
pm2 start /opt/start_tiddlywiki.sh
pm2 save
```

![Run successfully](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1637997881948i3Mxxrzt.png)

- Set pm2 to autostart

```
pm2 startup
```

## Use nginx to proxy the tiddlywiki service on port 8998

In the previous lesson of this series, "Raspberry Pi Home Server Setup Guide" Issue #9: How to set up a BBS forum flarum on Raspberry Pi with low cost and map it to the public network [https://v2fy.com/p/2021-11-26-flarum-1637921368000/](https://v2fy.com/p/2021-11-26-flarum-1637921368000/), we have completed forwarding the nginx 80 port service of Raspberry Pi to port 8666 of the server side through frp. For specific configuration, please refer to the last lesson, which is not repeated here.

- On the Raspberry Pi side, create a proxy configuration file for port 8998

```
sudo touch /etc/nginx/conf.d/wiki.v2fy.com.conf
sudo chmod 777 /etc/nginx/conf.d/wiki.v2fy.com.conf
```

- Write the following content into wiki.v2fy.com.conf

```
upstream wiki_v2fy_com { server 127.0.0.1:8998; }

server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  wiki.v2fy.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://wiki_v2fy_com;
        proxy_set_header Host $host:80;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```
- Restart nginx on Raspberry Pi

```
sudo nginx -t
sudo nginx -s reload
```

Enter the domain management interface and map wiki.v2fy.com to your own cloud host IP

![Cloud host](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1637997881996FJRGhmMB.png)

![Mapping successful](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/163799788197104k5MrMf.png)

- Log in to the server with a fixed IP
```
Following the tutorial [Zero-dependency! Using acme.sh to automatically renew multiple HTTPS certificates for Nginx, get unlimited certificate renewals https://v2fy.com/p/2021-06-27-nginx-https-1624774964000/], you can obtain a certificate with automatic unlimited renewals

- For a server with a fixed IP, the final content in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/wiki.v2fy.com.conf` is

```
upstream wiki_v2fy_com { server 127.0.0.1:8666; }

server {
    server_name      wiki.v2fy.com;
    listen           80;

    rewrite ^(.*)$ https://$host$1 permanent;

}


server {

    listen       443 ssl http2;
    listen       [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name  wiki.v2fy.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://wiki_v2fy_com;
        proxy_set_header Host $host:443;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

    ssl_certificate "/etc/nginx/ssl/wiki.v2fy.com/fullchain.cer";
    ssl_certificate_key "/etc/nginx/ssl/wiki.v2fy.com/wiki.v2fy.com.key";
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:1m;
    ssl_session_timeout  10m;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    # Load configuration files for the default server block.

    error_page 404 /404.html;
        location = /40x.html {
    }

    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
    }


}
```

- Restart the Nginx on the server with a fixed IP

```
nignx -t
nginx -s reload
```

- After the setup is complete, the TiddlyWiki service on the Raspberry Pi can be accessed via https://wiki.v2fy.com from the public network

## Setting up the Chinese Language Interface

Edit `/opt/wiki/tiddlywiki.info` to add the Chinese language configuration

```
    "languages": [
      "zh-Hans"
    ],
```

![Chinese](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1637997882064NK7dyrCZ.png)

- Restart TiddlyWiki

![Restarting the service](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1637997882151fs6AarDE.png)

```
pm2 restart start_tiddlywiki
```

- At this point, the Chinese language pack should load successfully

![Chinese language pack loaded successfully](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1637997882288wDjTBZKN.png)

- Switch to the Chinese language pack

## Setting Write Permissions

If you want to use Tiddly as a personal knowledge base, you need to create an account to control read and write permissions

```
touch /opt/wiki/users.csv
chmod 777 /opt/wiki/users.csv
```
Write the following content into users.csv

```
username,password
zhaoolee,zhaoolee
zhaoolee002,zhaoolee002
```

Modify the content of the startup file `/opt/start_tiddlywiki.sh` to

`tiddlywiki /opt/wiki --listen host=0.0.0.0  port=8998 credentials=/opt/wiki/users.csv readers=zhaoolee,zhaoolee002 writers=zhaoolee`

The startup file sets read and write permissions, both zhaoolee and zhaoolee002 accounts can read, zhaoolee can write

If you only want to control writing and allow anyone to read, simply remove `readers=zhaoolee,zhaoolee002`~

- Restart the service

```
pm2 restart start_tiddlywiki
```

- Open the page and enter the username and password to enter

![Login](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1637997882211srFFEpWP.png)

- Create a new note

![Create new note](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1637997882297A4y4nTCz.png)

Users with write permissions will have a **plus sign** on the page to create notes. The subject name of the created note can become a part of the URL, which can be shared with others.

`https://wiki.v2fy.com/#zhaoolee基于树莓派的网页笔记`

![Viewing notes](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1637997882260a2s4Kbry.png)

## Lastly, let's talk about TiddlyWiki's User Switching

TiddlyWiki uses Basic Auth for authentication, which is convenient for development but lacks a good user experience.

Current scenario: I set the permissions for wiki.v2fy.com so that it can be seen by anyone, but only certain people can modify it.
The corresponding startup command is

```
tiddlywiki /opt/wiki --listen host=0.0.0.0  port=8998 credentials=/opt/wiki/users.csv writers=zhaoolee
```

When opening the wiki.v2fy.com page, everything appears normal for guests. When I need to log in as admin zhaoolee, I need to first trigger the logout function.
![Trigger Logout](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1637997882422xS8eyPxy.png)

- Enter username and password to log in

![Enter username and password to log in](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1637997882337P6Axahaf.png)

- Login successful

![Login successful](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1637997882419k4BdrM7A.png)

It doesn't matter if there's an error; it doesn't affect our normal use.

- How to log out?

```
https://log:out@wiki.v2fy.com
```

## Summary

zhaoolee has used various kinds of note-taking software, but once exceeding a certain capacity, payment is required, and user data security is also hard to guarantee. TiddlyWiki is free and open-source, and with a wonderful combination of read-write permissions, it can be used as a private notebook or a public sticky note, featuring an elegant interface suitable for long-term use.
