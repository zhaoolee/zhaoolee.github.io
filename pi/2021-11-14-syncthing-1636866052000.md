Syncthing is an open-source, free, cross-platform file synchronization tool based on P2P technology that achieves file synchronization between devices without the need for server-transited traffic. The more devices involved in the synchronization, the faster the synchronization speed! Devices can achieve high-speed synchronization even when not on the same local network (the specific speed depends on the device's internet speed limit).

Syncthing will only store data on devices you trust, not on servers!

Open source address: https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing

## Install file synchronization service Syncthing
```
sudo curl -s -o /usr/share/keyrings/syncthing-archive-keyring.gpg https://syncthing.net/release-key.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/syncthing-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.syncthing.net/ syncthing stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/syncthing.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install syncthing
```

## Access Syncthing's web service through a browser

My Raspberry Pi's internal network IP is 192.168.50.223, so the address to visit is http://192.168.50.223:8384
```
http://192.168.50.223:8384
```

- After successful debugging, set Syncthing to run in the background as a pm2 daemon

```
mkdir /opt/syncthing-start/
cd /opt/syncthing-start/
echo "pm2 start /usr/bin/syncthing" > start_syncthing.sh
pm2 start /opt/syncthing-start/start_syncthing.sh
pm2 save
```

- Expose port 8384 to the public network

Configure the following content to the frp internal network penetration client configuration file at `/opt/frp_0.37.0_linux_arm64/frpc.ini`

For FRP installation and configuration, please refer to [“Dusting Off Your Raspberry Pi” Updating to Ubuntu Server 20.04, Binding a Public Domain Name, Providing HTTP Services to the Public, SSH Login Services](https://v2fy.com/p/2021-10-01-pi-server-1633066843000/)

```
[syncthing-v2fy-com-8384]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 8384
remote_port = 8384
```

- Restart the frpc service

```
pm2 restart start_frpc
pm2 save
```
![Restart frpc service](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1636866445758i00zGjWD.png)

- Open port 8384 of the cloud server

![Open](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1636866451261mabJDx4J.png)

- We have now resolved frp.v2fy.com to the server IP, so at this moment we can access the Syncthing service provided by the Raspberry Pi on any computer through http://frp.v2fy.com:8384

syncthing shares folders, with read-write permissions enabled by default. After syncing the Raspberry Pi folder to Windows, adding or deleting files in the corresponding Windows folder will also sync changes to the folder data on the Raspberry Pi.

## Summary

syncthing is an open-source, free p2p file synchronization tool. The data being synchronized does not go through a server transfer, but is transferred point-to-point, which greatly enhances synchronization speed, and it covers all platforms. syncthing defaults to data relay turned on; you can place a set of data on the Raspberry Pi, and other N devices can download it like a BT seed, taking data not only from the Raspberry Pi but also exchanging data between devices, reducing the dependence on the Raspberry Pi's bandwidth.

This kind of unlimited data sync program, high-speed and free, is much better than certain cloud sync drives. As long as the network is not terrible, files of tens of megabytes can be synchronized to all devices in just a few seconds.
