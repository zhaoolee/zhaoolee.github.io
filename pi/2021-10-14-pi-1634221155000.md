## Advantages of Raspberry Pi over PC

1. Raspberry Pi uses an ARM architecture processor with extremely low power consumption. Even when powering an external hard drive, the maximum power consumption does not exceed 15W.
2. Raspberry Pi has a rich set of interfaces, offering 2 USB 2.0 ports, 2 USB 3.0 ports, two micro-HDMI ports, 1 Type-C port, 1 extremely advanced headphone jack, an Ethernet port, and 40 GPIO pins.
3. Raspberry Pi is compact in size, only about the size of a credit card, and takes up hardly any space on a desk. With a transparent case, it makes for an excellent desktop decoration.
4. Raspberry Pi runs Linux, can be left on year-round, and is suitable for use as a home server. If you have a public domain name and a static IP, you can use frp to create an intranet penetration and turn your Raspberry Pi into a decent performing cloud server.
5. High EQ: Raspberry Pi is cost-effective! Low EQ: I'm poor, and Raspberry Pi is just affordable; The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a non-profit organization that aims to promote basic computer science education in schools with low-cost hardware and free software. The starting price is basically at cost, with the latest 4B version starting at $35 and the top-of-the-line 8GB memory version at only $75.
6. Raspberry Pi has many images available for fun. In addition to the official Raspberry Pi OS, you can also flash Ubuntu (a very popular desktop distribution in the Linux world), Windows 10 (you know what I mean), Arch (a minimalist Linux operating system), Kali (an operating system pre-installed with numerous hacking tools), OpenWRT (an open-source router operating system).
7. Flashing images on Raspberry Pi is convenient, requiring only the swapping of SD cards to quickly experience multiple systems. Additionally, the Raspberry Pi supports USB boot, making system flashing a joy if you have multiple USB drives or SD cards.
8. Raspberry Pi has a mature community, good software ecology, and an extremely active open-source community with geeks from all over the world sharing their fascinating open-source projects. Even Microsoft has customized a Win10 image for Raspberry Pi.
9. Raspberry Pi continuously pulls people into its fold with excellent hardware design, good stability, open-source software, continuously updated systems, **an affordable programming computer for students, the size of a credit card, for only $35**!
