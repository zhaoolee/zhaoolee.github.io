Samba services can be used to set up a high-quality private cloud. We can use the Samba protocol for content sharing on platforms like Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS.



However, due to the unique network environment in China, the default port 445 for Samba is blocked. If we want to set up our own Samba service, we must switch to another port, such as changing the default from 445 to 445001.



In the previous two articles written by zhaoolee:

have already provided detailed descriptions and illustrations on how Windows and Mac can connect to the Samba service on port 44501 from the public internet.



This article recommends apps for iOS and Android platforms that support connection to private Samba cloud drives via non-default ports, providing a pleasant user experience.

With that, we have completed the configuration of a self-built Samba cloud drive on the iOS system.



## Summary

Samba is an ideal file-sharing protocol, natively supported by Windows, Mac, and Linux. Android and iOS also support it through app installation. The combination of intranet penetration and the Samba protocol makes cross-device file sharing simple. Paired with Raspberry Pi intranet penetration, data security is ensured, and no speed limits are encountered. The storage space can be expanded infinitelyâ€”any USB drive or hard drive that can be connected to the Raspberry Pi becomes the new capacity of the cloud drive.
