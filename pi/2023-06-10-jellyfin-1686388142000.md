title: "Raspberry Pi Dust-Proof Guide" Issue 17 Combining Raspberry Pi with an Idle Laptop for a Superior Jellyfin Home Cinema
categories:
- Raspberry Pi Dust-Proof Guide / Use Pi

Jellyfin is an open-source, free home theater (media management) system that helps us organize the video resources on our hard drives and adds beautiful posters.



Jellyfin can record our playback progress. If a movie is played at 10 minutes and 20 seconds on device A, it can continue from 10 minutes and 20 seconds on device B.



Jellyfin has a complete user management system. Family members can have individual accounts, and their playback progress won't affect each other.

Jellyfin supports client playback and web playback. By accessing the webpage, we can manage and play our movie and TV show collection.



Jellyfin can freely convert formats, automatically converting high-bitrate resources like mkv to formats suitable for web transmission, for browser playback. For instance, high-bitrate 4K movies can be converted to 720p or even 360p, and transmitted through internal network penetration to family members outside the home network. If the home TV box is not powerful enough to play 4K originals, Jellyfin can real-time convert resources to 2K or 1080P streams for the TV box to play.

This article is the 17th issue of the "Raspberry Pi Dust-Proof Guide" series. The Raspberry Pi 4B is not powerful enough to support Jellyfin's real-time transcoding of 1080P videos, so we will use the Raspberry Pi as a gateway, running Jellyfin core services on an old computer in the home, while the Raspberry Pi reverse proxies the Jellyfin service to the home network and public internet.




## Installing Jellyfin Server

I happen to have a MacBook that I don't use often at home. This article will take macOS as an example (Windows platform configuration will be simpler), with the MacBook serving as the machine running the Jellyfin service.



Jellyfin Server download address: https://jellyfin.org/downloads/server

![image.png](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/16863882974314ZixzF5r.png)

- After installation, click on the Jellyfin icon to launch

![image.png](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1686388297874PS3D7fQN.png)

- Upon successful launch, the Jellyfin Server icon appears at the top

![image.png](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1686388301527tnY0W3KG.png)

- To ensure that Jellyfin Server starts automatically with each boot, we can add Jellyfin Server to the startup items

## Assign a Fixed IP to the Laptop via the Router



![image.png](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1686388316007r7QGkHXA.png)

Then, on any device in the LAN, we can access Jellyfin by using the fixed IP and port, for example, the fixed IP just set for the laptop is 192.168.50.74, and then any device in the LAN can access it through the browser at 192.168.50.74:8096




![image.png](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1686388321277FDP0QZke.png)


If 192.168.50.74 is hard to remember, we can use the more memorable Raspberry Pi LAN IP 192.169.50.10:8096 to proxy 192.168.50.74:8096, so the Raspberry Pi becomes the gateway of the entire home network, and the frpc of the Raspberry Pi can also map the Jellyfin service on port 8096 to the public internet




## Log into Raspberry Pi


In the Nginx configuration on the Raspberry Pi (IP: 192.168.50.10), we add a setup to forward the requests from 192.169.50.10:8096 to 192.168.50.74:8096




```
sudo bash -c 'cat > /etc/nginx/conf.d/192.168.50.74-8096.conf' <<-'EOF'
server {
    listen 8096;
    server_name 192.168.50.10;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://192.168.50.74:8096;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
EOF
```

Test the configuration file, restart Nginx




```
sudo nginx -t
sudo nginx -s reload
```

Then open `192.168.50.10:8096` in a browser

## Supports On-Demand Bitrate Switching

We store videos in 1080p or 4K on the server. If we want to save data while accessing from outside the network, we need to play 720p videos. Jellyfin can handle video conversion on the server after configuring ffmpeg. However, real-time video bitrate conversion can be CPU-intensive. By configuring hardware decoding on the Jellyfin server, CPU load can be reduced.




In addition to converting bitrates, ffmpeg can also convert formats. For example, if we've downloaded a movie in mkv format, which common browsers cannot directly play, ffmpeg can convert it to mp4 in real-time and push it to the browser at a lower bitrate. This allows for a seamless private movie library viewing experience using just a browser.



- Install ffmpeg

```
brew install ffmpeg
which ffmpeg
```

- View GPU hardware, enable hardware transcoding acceleration

![image.png](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/16863885901940ZWBpCkk.png)

Here, there's an option for hardware acceleration called Apple VideoToolBox but there is a bug that causes playback issues when converting to 360p low bitrate. So, in the end, I chose AMD AMF.

Remember to save after configuring hardware acceleration.

![image.png](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1686388598362H4rS4y1z.png)

For more hardware decoding configuration, refer to the official documentation https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/hardware-acceleration/

![image.png](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1686388630853TZwjMMdr.png)

After setup, you can play low-bitrate videos on devices where you want to save data (mobile networks) or on devices with weak decoding capabilities (old TV boxes).

## Add TV Shows to our media management library

Taking the British show Peaky Blinders as an example, we need to add the TMDB id to the main folder of the TV show.

## Map jellyfin to the public network

The Raspberry Pi serves as a home gateway, and frpc is already configured. We just need to add the following configuration to frpc.ini, and open port 8096 on the cloud server to make jellyfin accessible to the public network.

```
[jellyfin-frp-v2fy-com-8096]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 8096
remote_port = 8096
```
If you have any questions about frp's configuration, you are welcome to check out the first and fourth articles from the open-source project at https://github.com/zhaoolee/pi.

- After completing the setup, you can directly access your private theatre's video library via a browser on the public network!

## Add Music

Found a quick way to get music albums, sharing the method.

## First, install Python3

Download the installation package for your platform from the official Python website, available at https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Install the open-source software spotdl via the command line

```
pip3 install spotdl
```

Open-source URL: https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader

## Open Spotify, get the album link

```

- Download directly via the command line

```
spotdl https://open.spotify.com/album/6pmapc89HjY4f16ARzrmBB?si=aba55578f5c84463
```
- Wait for the download

The principle of the software is to obtain Spotify's song with the same name from YouTube's music channel and then download it. To use spotdl, your computer must be able to access YouTube. If you can't access YouTube, you can get free traffic by checking in at https://v2fy.com/p/109-glados-2021-06-09/ or set up your own server using Aliyun at https://v2fy.com/p/2023-03-01-v2ray-1677654246000/

## The Effect of Managing with Jellyfin {/*examples*/}

![image.png](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/16867472063132d8PtAMX.png)

Update in October 2023, after the National Day holiday, I found that the Wi-Fi in many public places in Shenzhen redirects HTTP requests to an anti-fraud page. It's really unsafe for Jellyfin to run on public network using port 8096.

## Adding Public Network HTTPS Support

Resolve your own domain name to a server with a public IP, taking `jellyfin.fangyuanxiaozhan.com` as an example

Create a configuration file on the server side: `touch /etc/nginx/conf.d/jellyfin.fangyuanxiaozhan.com.conf` and add the following content

```
upstream jellyfin_fangyuanxiaozhan_com { server 127.0.0.1:8096; }

server {
    server_name      jellyfin.fangyuanxiaozhan.com;
    listen           80;

    #rewrite ^(.*)$ https://$host$1 permanent;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://jellyfin_fangyuanxiaozhan_com;
        proxy_set_header Host $host:80;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```
- Restart nginx
```
nginx -t
nginx -s reload
```
- Visit `http://jellyfin.fangyuanxiaozhan.com`

![image.png](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/16981321816550he2K6CZ.png)

- Obtain HTTPS Certificate

```
# Extract variables
domain="jellyfin.fangyuanxiaozhan.com"
# Request Certificate
acme.sh --issue -d $domain --nginx /etc/nginx/conf.d/$domain.conf
# Create Directory
mkdir -p /etc/nginx/ssl/$domain/
# Install Certificate
acme.sh --install-cert -d $domain \
 --key-file       /etc/nginx/ssl/$domain/$domain.key  \
 --fullchain-file  /etc/nginx/ssl/$domain/fullchain.cer \
 --reloadcmd     "service nginx force-reload"
```

![image.png](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1698132181753DNMx4Wm8.png)

- Update `/etc/nginx/conf.d/jellyfin.fangyuanxiaozhan.com.conf`, to ensure communication security, enforce the use of HTTPS

```

upstream jellyfin_fangyuanxiaozhan_com { server 127.0.0.1:8096; }

server {
    server_name      jellyfin.fangyuanxiaozhan.com;
    listen           80;

    rewrite ^(.*)$ https://$host$1 permanent;

}

server {
    listen       443 ssl http2;
    listen       [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name  jellyfin.fangyuanxiaozhan.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://jellyfin_fangyuanxiaozhan_com;
        proxy_set_header Host $host:443;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

    ssl_certificate "/etc/nginx/ssl/jellyfin.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/fullchain.cer";
    ssl_certificate_key "/etc/nginx/ssl/jellyfin.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/jellyfin.fangyuanxiaozhan.com.key";
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:1m;
    ssl_session_timeout  10m;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    # Load configuration files for the default server block.

    error_page 404 /404.html;
        location = /40x.html {
    }

```
```nginx
error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
location = /50x.html {
}
}
```

- After the update, restart Nginx

```
nginx -t
nginx -s reload
```

At this moment, we no longer need port 8096. The server should close the external access to port 8096.

## Summary {#examples}

On the current Chinese internet, we can't even buy uncut high-quality films. Jellyfin provides us with these films without the need for a membership. Jellyfin is a free and ad-free platform. At home, we can enjoy high-quality resources over the local network, and away from home, we can continue where we left off, watching a version of the film that saves data.
