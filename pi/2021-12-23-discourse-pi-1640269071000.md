Discourse is a future-oriented BBS forum software, with the official offering paid hosting services. However, the software itself is open source, and it can be freely deployed on your own server.

Discourse perfectly supports both PC and mobile versions, and it also supports third-party plugins, which greatly facilitate custom forum setup.

Discourse provides a complete BBS forum maintenance plan, supports scheduled data backup, and auto-generates preview images for user-uploaded pictures.

Some time ago, I wrote two tutorials about deploying the Discourse forum:

[Building a cozy nest for enthusiastic guys, 2021's Ultimate Guide to Creating a New Generation BBS Forum with Discourse in 30 minutes https://v2fy.com/p/2021-06-12-discourse-2021-1623477573000/](https://v2fy.com/p/2021-06-12-discourse-2021-1623477573000/)

[Moving a cozy nest for enthusiastic guys, perfectly transferring the BBS website Discourse from overseas hosting to domestic cloud servers, achieving simultaneous operation of WordPress and Discourse on domestic hosting https://v2fy.com/p/2021-06-21-discourse-1624274883000/](https://v2fy.com/p/2021-06-21-discourse-1624274883000/)

The above tutorials are helpful for those who want to establish a personal forum.

However, a forum software like Discourse, with an accompanying Redis in-memory database, although it offers a great experience, puts a lot of pressure on server memory. Even though 2GB is enough to run it, the more memory, the smoother the experience. However, cloud services memory is too expensive. As a Raspberry Pi enthusiast, I have always tried to recompile Discourse's Docker for the ArmV8 processor on the Raspberry Pi, but it's always been somewhat imperfect.

But then, on December 7, 2021, Discourse officially supported deployment on Raspberry Pi in Docker form [https://blog.discourse.org/2021/12/2021-12-07-discourse-on-a-raspberry-pi/](https://blog.discourse.org/2021/12/2021-12-07-discourse-on-a-raspberry-pi/), which was fantastic news. In order to make the Discourse forum software run smoother and to relieve the pressure on cloud servers, I decided to migrate the Discourse forum software to Raspberry Pi~

If you already have a Discourse website online, you can first follow the method provided in [Moving a cozy nest for enthusiastic guys, perfectly transferring the BBS website Discourse from overseas hosting to domestic cloud servers, achieving simultaneous operation of WordPress and Discourse on domestic hosting https://v2fy.com/p/2021-06-21-discourse-1624274883000/](https://v2fy.com/p/2021-06-21-discourse-1624274883000/) to back up all data of Discourse, which would be convenient for the final migration to the Discourse service on Raspberry Pi. If you are starting from scratch on Raspberry Pi to build a Discourse site, then you can skip the steps of backing up and restoring data.

## Thinking about running Discourse on Raspberry Pi

I have set up a Discouse service on a cloud server, so as an example using my configuration, the ports mentioned below can theoretically be replaced arbitrarily.

Discourse occupies port 20080 (for HTTP service) and port 587 (for email service) when running on the cloud server. We will still reserve ports 20080 and 587 for Discourse on the Raspberry Pi, but port 20080 should be requested through port 80 of the Raspberry Pi's Nginx.

After exporting all the data of the Discourse forum on the cloud server end, shut down the Discourse service to free up ports 587 and 20080.

We need to configure two port penetrations in the frpc.ini on the Raspberry Pi: one is to directly penetrate port 587 of the Raspberry Pi to port 587 of the cloud server, and the other is to penetrate port 80 running Nginx on the Raspberry Pi to port 8666 of the cloud service.

We need to set the Nginx configuration file about the domain name bbs.v2fy.com on the cloud server end, change the original forwarding to port 20080 to port 8666. The effect is to forward requests from users to the cloud server to the Nginx service running on port 80 of the Raspberry Pi. Nginx recognizes bbs.v2fy.com and then forwards the corresponding requests to the Discourse service running on port 20080 of the Raspberry Pi.

Finally, restart the frpc service, the Nginx service on the Raspberry Pi, and the Nginx service on the cloud server end in turn, to complete the configuration.

The effect after configuration can be viewed through https://bbs.v2fy.com.

## Some specific configuration files

- Raspberry Pi Nginx Configuration

We place the configuration file for running Discoure on Nginx of Raspberry Pi at `/etc/nginx/conf.d/bbs.v2fy.com.conf`

```
upstream bbs_v2fy_com { server 127.0.0.1:20080; }

server {
    server_name      bbs.v2fy.com;
    listen           80;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://bbs_v2fy_com;
        proxy_set_header Host $host:80;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

    error_page 404 /404.html;
        location = /40x.html {
    }

    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
    }


}
```

The function of this `/etc/nginx/conf.d/bbs.v2fy.com.conf` configuration file is to direct all requests for bbs.v2fy.com to the Discourse service running on port 20080.

- Server-side Nginx Configuration

The location for the modification of Nginx related files on the server side is at `/etc/nginx/conf.d/bbs.v2fy.com.conf`

```
upstream bbs_v2fy_com { server 127.0.0.1:8666; }

server {
    server_name      bbs.v2fy.com;
    listen           80;


    rewrite ^(.*)$ https://$host$1 permanent;

    #location / {
    #    proxy_pass http://bbs_v2fy_com;
    #    proxy_set_header Host $host:80;
    #    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    #    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    #}
}
```
```
server {
    listen       443 ssl http2;
    listen       [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name  bbs.v2fy.com;

    ssl_certificate "/etc/nginx/ssl/bbs.v2fy.com/fullchain.cer";
    ssl_certificate_key "/etc/nginx/ssl/bbs.v2fy.com/bbs.v2fy.com.key";
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:1m;
    ssl_session_timeout  10m;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://bbs_v2fy_com;
        proxy_set_header Host $host:443;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

    error_page 404 /404.html;
        location = /40x.html {
    }

    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
    }
}

The role of this `/etc/nginx/conf.d/bbs.v2fy.com.conf` configuration file is to forward all HTTP services related to bbs.v2fy.com to port 8666, which happens to be forwarded to the Raspberry Pi running Nginx on port 80 through frp.

The server-side Nginx also added an HTTPS certificate for the domain bbs.v2fy.com through acme.sh and implemented automatic renewal. For details, see [Zero Dependency! Using acme.sh to set up automatic updates for multiple Nginx HTTPS certificates, and to renew HTTPS certificates indefinitely https://v2fy.com/p/2021-06-27-nginx-https-1624774964000/](https://v2fy.com/p/2021-06-27-nginx-https-1624774964000/)

## Raspberry Pi end FRP intranet penetration configuration

The location of the configuration file is `/opt/frp_0.37.0_linux_arm64/frpc.ini`

```
[common]
server_addr = your own server ip
server_port = 7000
token = 'your own token'
log_file = './frpc.log'

[nginx-v2fy-com-8666]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 80
remote_port = 8666

[bbs-v2fy-com-smtp-587]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 587
remote_port = 587
```

The role of this `frpc.ini` configuration file is: it has completed the penetration from the Raspberry Pi Nginx port 80 to the cloud server port 8666; it has also completed the penetration from the Raspberry Pi port 587 to the cloud server port 587.

## Obtaining the Discourse program on a Raspberry Pi

- Log in to the Raspberry Pi through ssh and obtain the main program of discourse

```
sudo -s
git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse_docker.git /opt/bbs.v2fy.com
cd /opt/bbs.v2fy.com
```


## Migration of Discourse configuration files

## Rebuilding Discourse on Raspberry Pi {#examples}

```
cd /opt/bbs.v2fy.com
sudo ./launcher rebuild app
```
After the build is completed, we can access our Discourse application running on Raspberry Pi via bbs.v2fy.com.
However, the BBS site is in its initial state. We can follow the methods provided by [Moving to a new nest for our enthusiastic brother, migrating the BBS website Discourse from an overseas host to a domestic cloud server smoothly, enabling both WordPress and Discourse to run on domestic hosts simultaneously https://v2fy.com/p/2021-06-21-discourse-1624274883000/](https://v2fy.com/p/2021-06-21-discourse-1624274883000/), use the scp command to restore the data to the Discourse service running on Raspberry Pi, thus completing the data migration.

## Summary

Recently, the control over comments in China has become stricter. Even the comment section on Bihu has been closed due to technical adjustments, and the reopening date is far in the future. Censorship of speech will become the norm, and many communities like Jian Shu are implementing indiscriminate keyword bans. Writing a good piece and discussing a topic online has become increasingly difficult.

There is a Chinese saying, "Fear of getting famous is like fear of a pig getting fat," but the reverse is also true. As long as the traffic to your own BBS is not too large, there will be a natural barrier for discussions on specific niche topics.

How expensive is it to build a BBS? According to the solution provided in this article, with a Raspberry Pi, a host with a static IP costing about 20 yuan per month, and a domain name costing a few tens of yuan per year, the annual maintenance cost is around 300 yuan. If you want to add Google Adsense (Google Ad), you might even make some money.
