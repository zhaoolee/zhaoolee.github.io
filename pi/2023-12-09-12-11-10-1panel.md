title: "Raspberry Pi No Dust Collector" Issue 24 Laziness is the Primary Productive Force, Installing the Visual Open Source Management Panel 1Panel on Raspberry Pi
categories:
- Raspberry Pi No Dust Collector / Use Pi
---

Recently, a buddy recommended a modern Linux open source control panel called 1Panel. It's open-source and stable. Laziness is the primary productive force. Although the command line is flexible, a graphical interface is truly a necessity for the lazy. In this issue, we deploy 1Panel on the Raspberry Pi to make Linux operations on Pi more labor-saving and further lower the barrier to Raspberry Pi hobbies. Open-source address: https://github.com/1Panel-dev/1Panel

## Installing 1Panel

```
curl -sSL https://resource.fit2cloud.com/1panel/package/quick_start.sh -o quick_start.sh && sudo bash quick_start.sh
```

If we access port 38414 directly, it will prompt "No permission." We must access the full path with routing. If the access path is forgotten, enter `1pctl user-info` in the Raspberry Pi terminal to check.

On the homepage, we can see the current operating status of the Raspberry Pi, and system information. The CPU is running at 90% utilization, and memory at 60% utilization. The Raspberry Pi has been utilized effectively by zhaoolee, and it's indeed not gathering dust! (Raspberry Pi: Thank you!)

We can also check the running status of various Docker containers through the Container menu.

## Download Server Files to Local Through Browser

We can directly download files from the Raspberry Pi to the local machine through the browser.

## Using ssh in the Browser

We can use terminal command lines to control Raspberry Pi directly through the browser.

## Installing Software Through the App Store

1Panel also has a very convenient feature, which is to install various environments and open-source projects with one click. Here we demonstrate the installation of a third-party NetEase cloud music client, YesPlayMusic.

After clicking install, a confirmation panel appears. For the sake of demonstration, we allow external access.

![image-20231209131005539](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1702098609990zw0XbY8P.png)

Following the prompt in the above image, we can view YesPlayMusic running on the Raspberry Pi by accessing port 40075.

## Mapping 1Panel to the Public Network

If you want to access your Raspberry Pi from any internet-connected location using 1Panel, you can employ traditional skills to map 1Panel to the public network via frp. Considering security, I will use HTTPS encryption to forward the access from https://1panel.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/ to port 38414 of the home Raspberry Pi.

First, add the following configuration to the frpc.ini on Raspberry Pi, and restart the frpc service on Raspberry Pi to make it effective.

```
[1panel-fangyuanxiaozhan-com-38414]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 38414
remote_port = 38414
```

Then add a configuration file to the cloud server's NGINX `/etc/nginx/conf.d/1panel.fangyuanxiaozhan.com.conf`.

```
upstream 1panel_fangyuanxiaozhan_com { server 127.0.0.1:38414; }

server {
  server_name      1panel.fangyuanxiaozhan.com;
  listen           80;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://1panel_fangyuanxiaozhan_com;
    proxy_set_header Host $host:80;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  }
}
```

## Applying for a Certificate Through acme

```
domain="1panel.fangyuanxiaozhan.com"
# Requesting a certificate
acme.sh --issue -d $domain --nginx /etc/nginx/conf.d/$domain.conf
```
# Create Directory
mkdir -p /etc/nginx/ssl/$domain/
# Install Certificate
acme.sh --install-cert -d $domain \
--key-file       /etc/nginx/ssl/$domain/$domain.key  \
--fullchain-file  /etc/nginx/ssl/$domain/fullchain.cer \
--reloadcmd     "service nginx force-reload"
```

Replace the contents of `/etc/nignx/conf.d/1panel.fangyuanxiaozhan.com.conf` with the following content

```
upstream 1panel_fangyuanxiaozhan_com { server 127.0.0.1:38414; }

server {
    server_name      1panel.fangyuanxiaozhan.com;
    listen           80;

    rewrite ^(.*)$ https://$host$1 permanent;

}

server {
    listen       443 ssl http2;
    listen       [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name  1panel.fangyuanxiaozhan.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://1panel_fangyuanxiaozhan_com;
        proxy_set_header Host $host:443;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

    ssl_certificate "/etc/nginx/ssl/1panel.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/fullchain.cer";
    ssl_certificate_key "/etc/nginx/ssl/1panel.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/1panel.fangyuanxiaozhan.com.key";
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:1m;
    ssl_session_timeout  10m;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    # Load configuration files for the default server block.

    error_page 404 /404.html;
        location = /40x.html {
    }

    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
    }
}
```
Finally, restart the server-side nginx
```
nginx -s reload
```

Access 1panel through the browser on the public Internet

## Summary

If you want to keep an eye on the operation of the Raspberry Pi at all times, 1Panel is a good choice. It is open source and free, makes full use of Docker's features, allows for one-click configuration of various environments, and the installation of various software.

The open-source address for the "Raspberry Pi Not Collecting Dust" series is github.com/zhaoolee/pi
